 Wl\nAbout half of the world\u2019s languages contrast two series of obstruents differing\nin their laryngeal properties, e.g., [p] and [b]. This \u201cvoiced\u2013voiceless\u201d contrast can\nbe observed in both Hungarian and English, for example, as indicated by minimal\npairs like Hun. /b/\u00e1l \u2018ball\u2019 \u2013 /p/\u00e1l \u2018Paul\u2019 and Eng. /b/all \u2013 /p/aul. Although we can\nuse the terms \u201cvoiced\u201d and \u201cvoiceless\u201d to identify the two types of obstruent in\nboth languages, we must be aware that the phonetic, i.e., physical, realizations of\nthis opposition are different\u2014contrary to what the orthographic conventions\nsuggest.\n         As an illustration, you can see in (2) the waveforms of four sound recordings\nin which a Hungarian and an English native speaker pronounce the above-\nmentioned minimal pairs. Under the waveforms, you can find the spectrograms of\nthe four recordings, in which the darker areas indicate the dominant frequencies\nof the given sounds (between 0 and 5,000 Hz) and their change over time. Without\ngoing into too much detail about it, let us compare the laryngeal properties of these\nword-initial plosives, separated from the rest of the word by vertical lines in the\nfigures: The /b/ in Hun. b\u00e1l is characterized by actual vocal fold vibration (i.e.,\nvoicing), which is indicated by the periodic waveform already in the closure phase\n1    The set texts for this lesson, besides the present reading and the slides, are from the textbook\n     of the Phonology lecture course (BBN-ANG-241):\n          Zolt\u00e1n G.

If we compare the initial plosive of Hun. P\u00e1l with that of Eng.\nball, it is clear that they can be pronounced identically: the closure phase is silent,\nand vocal fold vibration begins upon release in both cases, i.e., they are voiceless\nunaspirated. Finally, Eng. Paul also begins with a voiceless plosive; moreover,\nvocal fold vibration in the next vowel is delayed (by 105 milliseconds), i.e., the\nplosive is aspirated, which is realized as a [h] sound following the plosive: [ph]. In\nwords like play, where the plosive is followed by a sonorant consonant (more\nprecisely, an approximant/a nonnasal sonorant consonant), aspiration is\nmanifested as the devoicing of the sonorant consonant: [pl\u0325].\n\n(2)\n                           Hun: bal                         b_  Hun.

Voiced plosives, in which\nvoicing begins prior to the release of the stops, are characterized by negative\nVOT. In the case of voiceless unaspirated plosives, where vocal fold vibration\nbegins right around its release, we can talk of zero or short-lag VOT. Finally,\nvoiceless aspirated plosives have positive VOT values (a.k.a. long-lag VOT),\nwhich means that voicing is delayed, i.e., lags behind the release of the stop (e.g.,\nin the case of the /p/ of Paul in the above figure, VOT = +105 milliseconds).

These plosives are aspirated in thet\nfollowing environments (defined with reference to syllables): (i) word-initially (e.g.,\nin [ph]\u00e1ralyze, [ph]ol\u00edte and [pl\u0325]\u00e1y) and (ii) at the beginning of a stressed syllable\n(e.g., in a.[ph]\u00e9ar and a.[pr\u0325]\u00f3ve). In other positions, we find the unaspirated\nalternants (e.g., in ca[p] and ca[p].tain, where the bilabial plosives are syllable-\nfinal, or in h\u00e1.[p]en, where it is not word-initially and is at the beginning of an\nunstressed syllable). For further details about this allophonic alternation, please\nread \u201cThe distribution of aspiration\u201d6 and \u201cThe effect of syllables\u201d7 in Phonolec\nnotes.\n         Now, let us turn to voicing in English. In the case of sonorant segments\n(i.e., vowels and sonorant consonants), the unmarked (= phonetically most\nnatural) way of articulating them is with vocal fold vibration (in any language);\nthis type of phonation (or voicing) is called spontaneous voicing. The unmarked\ncase for obstruents, on the other hand, is to be voiceless (in any language), and in\nEnglish, they can only be passively voiced. That is, if a native speaker of English\npronounces an obstruent voiced, vocal fold vibration is not an articulatory target\n3    http://www.budling.hu/~cash/courses/phonolec/phonolec-notes/voicing.html#the-phonetics-of-\n     voicing\n4    http://www.budling.hu/~cash/courses/phonolec/phonolec-notes/aspiration.html#the-\n     phonetics-of-aspiration\n5    http://www.budling.hu/~cash/courses/phonolec/phonolec-notes/voicing.html#voice-onset-time\n6    http://www.budling.hu/~cash/courses/phonolec/phonolec-notes/aspiration.html#the-\n     distribution-of-aspiration\n7    http://www.budling.hu/~cash/courses/phonolec/phonolec-notes/aspiration.html#the-effect-of-\n     syllables\n                                                        3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2755, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9418f2c7-dfde-4beb-8210-b67ede99bff0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9418f2c7-dfde-4beb-8210-b67ede99bff0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dde7c900-9372-44fb-bb27-82137fe1bf82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ae6c94a6790ebdd73ed887aa5b517cf662a0db8fd3a1f9a2918100135fcec0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2a34250-77b2-4f23-a379-3a86843acc46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83f6db85650c93f0b44e9e48b09838f6c9dbca0afeb2f82a9ab20cc83355a98e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Analyzing laryngeal contrasts\n\nbut can only be the effect of the neighboring sounds: if an obstruent is in\nintersonorant position, the voicing of the sonorants preceding and following it will\n\u201crun through\u201d it, turning it voiced.

In Hungarian, voicing in obstruents is the result of activet\narticulatory gestures, so here, we talk of active voicing. For further details on\nvoicing and its distribution in English, please read \u201cTypes of phonetic voicing\u201d8 in\nPhonolec notes.\n         What we have learned so far about the physical realizations of the\nlaryngeal contrast in English can be summarized and illustrated through the\nfollowing examples: In /p/aul vs. /b/all, the opposition is encoded as the presence\nvs. absence of aspiration: [ph]aul vs. [b\u0325~p]all. The situation is the same /p/ride vs.\n/b/ride, but here, aspiration is realized as the devoicing of the following sonorant\nconsonant: [pr\u0325]ide vs. [b\u0325~p]ride. The laryngeal contrast is realized as the presence\nvs. absence of aspiration in de/k/r\u00e9e vs. de/g/r\u00e9e too, as the /k/ in the former is at the\nbeginning of a stressed syllable; furthermore, since the /g/ in the latter is in\nintersonorant position, it will be passively voiced, an additional phonetic cue\nencoding the opposition: de[kr\u0325]\u00e9e vs. de[g]r\u00e9e. As for \u00e1//om vs. \u00c1/d/am, the // in thet             t\nformer is not aspirated because it occurs word-medially and not at the beginning\nof a stressed syllable; however, the contrast is maintained via the passive voicing\nof the intersonorant /d/: \u00e1[]om vs. \u00c1[d]am.t\n         What remains to be discussed is the following: as the // in ba// is nott                   t\naspirated, and the /d/ in ba/d/ does not undergo passive voicing if not followed by a\nsonorant segment, both of them tend to be pronounced as a voiceless unaspirated\n[]. Nevertheless, the laryngeal contrast is not neutralized (= does not disappear)\n t\nin final position either. Then what phonetic cues are used to encode the opposition?\nAs can be seen in (4), a vowel before \u201cvoiceless\u201d obstruents tends to be shorter than\na vowel before their \u201cvoiced\u201d counterparts (e.g., bat [ba\u0306 t] vs. bad [ba\u0304 d\u0325~ba\u0304 t] and rice\n[r\u0251\u0306j\u0306s] vs. rise [r\u0251\u0304j\u0304z\u0325~r\u0251\u0304j\u0304s]), which is referred to as prefortis clipping (= prevoiceless\nshortening). A further phonetic cue that can encode \u201cvoicelessness\u201d in the case of\nplosives and the affricate /\u02a7/ in this position is preglottalization (a.k.a. glottal\nreinforcement), i.e., the pronunciation of the glottal stop [\u0294] before these segments\n(e.g., in bat [ba\u0306 \u0294t]).

So\nwhile we can find aspirated plosives in words like [ph]eak and [kh]ool, the plosives\nin s[p]eak and s[k]ool are unaspirated, and so are the ones in dis[k]\u00f3very and\nf\u00edf[]\u00e9en (cf. n\u00edne[th]\u00e9en).t\n           To account for the absence of aspiration in fortis fricative + plosive clusters,\nwe may resort to referring to syllables. Note that we said earlier that a fortis\nplosive can be aspirated at the beginning of a word or at the beginning of a stressed\nsyllable. This condition is not fulfilled in s[p]eak, s[k]ool and di.s[k]\u00f3.ve.ry, as their\nplosives are not word- or syllable-initial, so we indeed expect them not to be\naspirated. However, there is no aspiration in words like f\u00edf[]\u00e9en or k\u00e1f[]an either.t                                 t\nThe absence of aspiration could fall out of our syllable-based analysis only if we\nassumed the following syllabifications: f\u00ed.f[]\u00e9en or k\u00e1.f[]an, ending up with at                 t\nsyllable-initial /ft/ cluster, which does not occur word-initially. This leads to a\npeculiar situation since the occurrence of a consonant cluster in syllable-initial\nposition is generally taken to imply the occurrence of that cluster in word-initial\nposition too (therefore, e.g., atlas is to be syllabified as at.las and not as *a.tlas\nbecause /tl/ is not a possible word-initial cluster).\n           The problem seems to be better solved if we do not let the spelling affect our\nphonological analysis. If we have an audio recording of the word speak, and we\nchop off the /s/ from the beginning of the word and ask a native speaker to identify\nthe word they hear, they will say beak and not peak. It should not be too surprising\nif we know that a word-initial plosive pronounced without aspiration will be\nperceived as a lenis segment.

The phonetic basis for the assumption of two laryngeal features\nAs discussed above, contrary to what the phonemic transcription suggests\n(together with the spelling), the phonetic (i.e., physical) realizations of plosives in\nword-initial position are different in the two languages. In Hungarian, it is actual\nvocal fold vibration, i.e., active voicing, that the contrast lies in: /pa\u02d0l/ is pronounced\n[pa\u02d0l], and /ba\u02d0l/ is [ba\u02d0l] on the surface too. In English, on the other hand, the lenis\nplosive of /bo\u02d0l/ is not necessarily voiced on the surface (it tends to be only partially\nvoiced or totally voiceless, so [b\u0325o\u02d0l~po\u02d0l]), and the fortis plosive of /po\u02d0l/ is not only\nvoiceless but also aspirated ([pho\u02d0l]), which show that the distinctive laryngeal\nproperty in word-initial plosives in English is not voicing but aspiration.\nTherefore, more recently, in nontraditional analyses, obstruents like /b, d, g; v, \u00f0,\nz, \u0292; \u02a4/ continue to be laryngeally specified in Hungarian-type languages, so\nthey contain the feature [voice]; the laryngeally unspecified series contains\nobstruents like /p, , k; , \u03b8, s, , h; \u02a7/; however, in English, laryngeal specification ist  f  \u0283\nthe other way around: /b, d, g; v, \u00f0, z, \u0292; \u02a4/, which are only passively voiced in\nintersonorant position, form the unspecified series, while /p, , k; , \u03b8, s, , h; \u02a7/, thet                                                                     f       \u0283\nplosives of which bear the distinctive property aspiration, are taken to be specified\nfor a distinctive feature, [fortis].\n\nb. The phonological basis for the assumption of two laryngeal features\nBesides the phonetic realizations of obstruents, their phonological behaviors also\nsupport the idea that the two obstruent series should be represented differently in\nthe two language types. Let us consider the English word /d\u026asgra\u0301 f\u026aj\u0259/ and its\nHungarian equivalent, /dizgra\u02d0fi\u0254/. What happens in Hungarian is that the voiceless\n/s/ of the prefix /dis/ undergoes voicing due to the voiced /g/ following it in the next\nmorpheme (we know that the final obstruent of the prefix was underlyingly /dis/\nby observing forms like /disl\u025bksi\u0254/, where the following sound is a sonorant\nconsonant or vowel (in this case, //), which cannot change the laryngeal identity ofl\nthe final obstruent of the prefix). This process is called voice assimilation, and\nas its direction is right-to-left, it is referred to as regressive voice assimilation.\nAs for English, no such assimilation takes place, which is what we expect since\n\n                                                                                                              8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 127, "end_char_idx": 3554, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35ab6760-7745-47bd-82f2-b40a049d25a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "35ab6760-7745-47bd-82f2-b40a049d25a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6caeb9ff-426b-4906-a50e-56e0198357a3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ceb8a24b01c167869c35b799cd004fb70789e87a8ed953b098189f76361324eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BBN-ANG-243 Advanced Phonology: Phonological Analysis\n\nvoicing is not a distinctive property of lenis obstruents in the language.

However, there exist a few laryngeal\nsystems in which these two criteria for the categorization as a voicing or an\naspirating language are not both met.

The last but\none section (\u00a76) tentatively extends the analysis of diphthongs to long vowels.\nConclusions end the paper (\u00a77).\n\n1 Three sets of vowels\nWe begin by introducing the three sets of vowels: short monophthongs (\u00a71.1),\ndiphthongs (\u00a71.2), and long monophthongs (\u00a71.3). As we will see these are not\nonly phonetic categories, but \u2014 more importantly \u2014 phonological, ie phonotactic\nones (\u00a71.4). The vowel inventory of British English may be divided by the most\ngeneral phonotactic patterns.\n\n1.1 Short monophthongs\nLindsey (2012) distinguishes the six short vowels shown in (1).\n\n(1)\nkit     \u026a       foot \u0275\ndress \u025b         lot     \u0254\ntrap a          strut \u0259\nContrary to the British transcribing tradition, Lindsey does not necessarily use\nseparate symbols for schwa and the vowel of strut. This is justifiable because\nthese two vowels do not contrast: schwa only occurs in unstressed syllables,\nstrut only in stressed syllables. The difference between the vowels of\nblunderers and blunderbuss may be seen as one of stress: bl\u0259\u0301nd\u0259r\u0259z vs bl\u0259\u0301nd\u0259b\u0259\u0300s.\nIt is exactly because of this difference in their distribution that\npedagogically oriented works employ the symbol \u028c for strut, despite the fact\nthat a schwa, especially word finally, can be phonetically equivalent to strut\n(Jones 1922: \u00a7493, 1960: \u00a7362).\n\nLindsey\u2019s symbols \u2014 like most other symbol sets used for transcribing British\nEnglish \u2014 aim to be phonetically precise. The advantages of this practice are\nclear, but there are certain disadvantages too. The inventory in (1) looks quite\nalien, in fact the totally unfamiliar symbols do not help the everyday language\nlearner, who form the vast majority of the consumers of these transcriptions. If\none has to explain how a symbol like \u0275 ought to be pronounced anyway, one might\nconsider using something simpler. This simplification is also desirable in a\ntheoretically oriented approach, because it lets the analyst posit a system.\nThis is why we are going to use alternative, but very familiar symbols in this\npaper.

Finally, let us quote Bloomfield: \u201cThe\nshapes of the graphic symbols scarcely deserve discussion. The reader who\nprefers the symbol [\u00e6] where I use [\u025b] does not need any factual basis to\njustify his preference\u201d (1935: 98). Mutatis mutandis, this consideration is\nvalid for all of our symbol replacements.\n\n1.2 Diphthongs\nThere is consensus on what the short vowels of English are, idiosyncrasies of\ninventories boil down to symbol choice only. As has been shown, using schwa for\nstrut is also a \u201csymbolic\u201d question after all. The case is different with the\nset of diphthongs Lindsey posits.\n\nThe vowels of price, mouth, and choice are analysed (ie transcribed) as\ndiphthongs in most transcription systems of English. The American tradition\noften has monophthongal symbols for face (e) and goat (o), but the British\ntradition is also rather consistent in seeing these two vowels as diphthongs\ntoo. fleece and goose, on the other hand, are consistently taken to be long\nmonophthongs (i\u02d0 and u\u02d0), from Jones (1918)Daniel Jones, An Outline of English\nPhonetics, Leipzig: Teubner onwards. Interestingly, these vowels were\ntranscribed as ij and uw by Sweet (1900)Henry Sweet, A New English Grammar:\nLogical and Historical. Oxford: Clarendon Press. at the end of the 19th century,\nand Jones and his successors do not fail to mention that these two vowels are\noften pronounced as diphthongs. As we will see below, there is robust\ndistributional evidence that they are diphthongs.\n\nAccordingly, Lindsey represents them so.\n\n(3)\nfleece          \u026aj      goose \u0289w\nface \u025bj         goat \u0259w\nchoice          oj\nprice \u0251j        mouth aw\nJust as in the case of short vowels, we could and will use a set of simpler\nvowel symbols, shown in (4).\n\n(4)\nfleece          ij      goose uw\nface ej         goat \u0259w\nchoice          oj\nprice aj        mouth aw\nThe diphthongs of British English may end in one of two types of offglide, i\u032f or\nu\u032f. Gimson\u2019s (1962) innovation that these should be transcribed by \u026a and \u028a might\nhave been phonetically exact for Received Pronunciation in the middle of the\n20th century, but even then it was unnecessarily overprecise. The vowel symbols\ni and u are not particularly fortunate either for indicating the offglide of a\ndiphthong, because they represent syllabic segments, which diphthongal offglides\nare not. Nonsyllabicity can be represented by a diacritic, as i\u032f and u\u032f, but using\nthe phonetically equivalent symbols j and w is an even simpler and just as\nadequate solution.\n\nReaders familiar with the Jones/Gimson tradition of the transcription of British\nEnglish may find the set of diphthongs lacking three members, the so called\ncentring diphthongs, the vowels of near, square, and cure. Following Lindsey, we\nanalyse these three vowels as long monophthongs, which we will discuss\npresently.\n\n1.3 Long monophthongs", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3103, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62924167-c913-44d5-bb95-a77aea60243e": {"__data__": {"id_": "62924167-c913-44d5-bb95-a77aea60243e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f95a945-8687-4de6-a02a-a4de8890405d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94253b6e68f8b377ce0bf87670f2704676196bf91f365c4cf534dd001bbe6cd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79750df0-642c-4d83-a5a7-ccf828bfa873", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55d52373e40cb4b6b75adde5a634c62768f7e6f58614f33a76d58381c123d28e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We have already seen that Lindsey departs from the traditional classification of\nthe nonshort vowels: fleece and goose are analysed as diphthongs, near, square,\nand cure as long monophthongs. square is clearly a monophthong, and began to be\ntranscribed as such by Upton (1995). Its status is rather similar to that of\nforce, for which Jones records a diphthongal \u0254\u0259 pronunciation almost a century\nago, but he deems it obsolete already in those days. The reason force became\nestablished as a monophthong is that separate symbols for it and north could not\nbe maintained once the two vowels ceased to contrast. The homophonous pair\nmourning and morning cannot be transcribed differently, with \u0254\u0259 and \u0254\u02d0. On the\nother hand, nothing forced the introduction of the monophthongal symbol for\nsquare, since this vowel did not merge with any other vowel of the British\ninventory, so the \u201cphonetically precise\u201d symbol \u025b\u02d0 turned up only at the end of\nthe 20th century.\n\nBoth near and cure are more variable than square, but in different ways. near is\nusually monophthongal before a consonant, especially before r: eg hero h\u026a\u02d0r\u0259w,\nnearer n\u026a\u02d0r\u0259, pierce p\u026a\u02d0s, here you are h\u026a\u02d0 juw \u0251\u02d0. Utterance finally this vowel\nmay split up into two syllables, the diphthong ij followed by schwa: you're here\njo\u02d0 hij\u0259. This kind of variation is found in other vowels too: eg fire faj\u0259 vs\nfire brigade fa\u02d0 br\u0259gejd, sour saw\u0259 vs sour sauce sa\u02d0 so\u02d0s.\n\ncure, on the other hand, has split into two different vowels for some speakers.\nAfter palatal consonants these speakers pronounce either the long version of\nfoot (eg cure kj\u0275\u02d0, jury \u02a4\u0275\u02d0rij, sure \u0283\u0275\u02d0), or they merge this vowel with nurse\n(kj\u0259\u02d0, \u02a4\u0259\u02d0rij, \u0283\u0259\u02d0). Elsewhere cure has merged with force: eg poor po\u02d0, tour\nto\u02d0, gourmand go\u02d0m\u0259nd. Let us call this phenomenon the Poor\u2013Cure Split. Speakers\nwho do not have the Poor\u2013Cure Split have cure and force merged in all\nenvironments: eg cure kjo\u02d0, jury \u02a4o\u02d0rij, sure \u0283o\u02d0, poor po\u02d0.\n\nThe rest of the long monophthongs have been analysed as such in the British\ntradition throughout the 20th century.

Many\nspeakers even insert a consonant, r, after a word-final long monophthong or a\nschwa if the next word or suffix begins with a vowel: eg draw out dro\u02d0r awt,\ndrawing dro\u02d0ri\u014b.\n\nIt is only the diphthongs that occur unconstrained in these three types of\nenvironment, ie we can find diphthongs before a consonant, before a vowel, or at\nthe end of a word. There are some constraints on diphthongs before consonant\nclusters, but while two of the long monophthongs, i\u02d0 and e\u02d0,\u00bb never occur before\na cluster, all of the diphthongs do. Also u\u02d0 for those speakers who have it.\n\nWe now turn to examining the nonshort vowels of British English, to see if they\nreally constitute complex vowels that are part of the vowel inventory.\n\n2 Parts of a diphthong\nOne argument for the integrity of the sequence of a vowel followed by a glide is\nthat not any glide may follow any vowel, ie the two parts of a diphthong are\nphonotactically related. This may easily be verified if we take another look at\nthe diphthongs of English, shown in (9).\n\n(9)\n\n        j               w\ni       ij fleece\ne       ej face\na       aj price        aw mouth\no       oj choice\nu                       uw goose\n\u0259                       \u0259w goat\nThe distribution of the two glides after the short vowels is almost\ncomplementary, there is one exception: both glides occur with a as their first\nelement. Phonetically these two low vowels are different, the one in aj is more\nback (hence Lindsey\u2019s symbol \u0251j), the other one in aw is more front. We believe\nthat such detail need not be indicated in phonological transcription, which is\nnot concerned with the precise phonetic content of its symbols.\u00bb\nNote, for example, that the symbol r is widely used for sounds that are very\ndifferent from an alveolar trill.\n\nHowever, very similar charts can be produced about consonants, yet they are not\nused for arguing for the integrity of these clusters. Consider the facts in\n(10).

An even more recent development in\nBritish English is the fronting of the glides of goose and goat. This change\nresults in these lexical sets having vowel+glide sequences that could be\ntranscribed as uj and \u0259j, respectively (Altendorf & Watt 2004: 191). But, as a\nresult of L vocalization, we are not left without uw and \u0259w as the examples in\n(12) show.\n\n(12)\n        j                       w\ni       ij fleece               iw bill\ne       ej face                         ew bell\na       aj price                aw mouth\no       oj choice               ow ball\nu       uj goose                uw bull\n\u0259       \u0259j goat                         \u0259w dull\nCrucially, however, we do not need a fully saturated vowel+glide chart, like the\none in (12), to argue for treating the two parts of a diphthong as separate\nentities. That is, vowel+glide sequences are not necessarily diphthongs even in\naccents that only have those listed in (9).\n\n3 Gaps in glide distribution?\nIf we examine the distribution of nonnasal sonorants in English, ie l r j w h,\nwe see that they typically occur in prevocalic environments. In fact, in L\nvocalizing accents, all these consonants occur exclusively prevocalically. They\nare, however largely insensitive to the environment that precedes them. This is\nshown in (13). Note that h occurs before the consonant j (and for some before w\ntoo), but only if a stressed vowel follows (eg huge hj\u00faw\u02a4, what (h)w\u00f3t).

All three marginally\noccur before an unstressed vowel, but with various restrictions: typically the\npreceding vowel must be long or unstressed (eg Darwin d\u00e1\u02d0win, Malawi m\u0259l\u00e1\u02d0wij,\nnarwhal n\u00e1\u02d0w\u0259l, Ottawa \u00f3t\u0259w\u0259; yahoo j\u00e1\u02d0huw, Monahan m\u00f3n\u0259h\u0259n; sawyer s\u00f3\u02d0j\u0259). The\nvowel before these three consonants, however, cannot be short and stressed (cf\nPolg\u00e1rdi 2015 ), we have found only some Celtic names that go against this\nrestriction: Dewi d\u00e9wij, Drogheda dr\u00f3h\u0259d\u0259, Mulcahy m\u0259lk\u00e1hij.\n\nInstead of asking why j, w, and h may not occur after a short vowel, let us ask\n\u2014 like our smart students \u2014 if this is really the case. We contend that this\nimpression is a result of analysing vowel+glide sequences as diphthongs. In\nfact, if we take them to be what they are, vowel+glide sequences, then the gap\nin the distribution of glides disappears. In (15) we list a small subset of the\nmany words that contain a short vowel followed by j or w.\n\n(15)\nneon n\u00edjon, crayon kr\u00e9j\u0259n, lion l\u00e1j\u0259n, royal r\u00f3j\u0259l, vowel v\u00e1w\u0259l, Noah n\u0259\u0301w\u0259, fuel\nfj\u00faw\u0259l\nIn fact, if we analyse diphthongs in this way, glides will not be impossible\nword finally or preconsonantally any more. Words like eye aj or toe t\u0259w now end\nin a glide, while others like ice ajs or toad t\u0259wd contain preconsonantal\nglides.\n\n4 Epenthesis\nEnglish has consonant clusters word finally (eg lamp, sink, list, risk, lift,\npact). However, not any combination of two consonants is possible at the end of\na word. One limiting factor is sonority: the second member of a word-final\nconsonant cluster is typically less sonorous than the first. Many words that\nentered English with a cluster that conflicted with this requirement were\namended by epenthesizing \u0259 between the two consonants: eg French m\u00e8tre m\u025btr >\nmijt\u0259r, Old French temple > temp\u0259l, Late Latin prisma > priz\u0259m. In other cases\nwe find two word-final consonants that are not \u201cdifferent enough\u201d to form a\ncluster: eg matches ma\u02a7+z > ma\u02a7\u0259z or fitted fit+d > fit\u0259d. These are again\nbroken up by epenthesis.\n\nWhile the clusters mentioned so far are invariably broken up by speakers of\nEnglish, others are variable in this respect: eg elm elm or el\u0259m, farm fa\u0279m or\nfa\u0279\u0259m, earn \u0259\u02d0\u0279n or \u0259\u02d0\u0279\u0259n, girl g\u0259\u02d0\u0279l or g\u0259\u02d0\u0279\u0259l (Trawick-Smith 2015, also Wells\n1982: 435). Standard versions of the sonority hierarchy order these consonants\nas m = n < l < r (cf Szigetv\u00e1ri 2008 : 95f and references there), so these\nclusters look acceptable falling sonority clusters. Nevertheless, it seems that\nthe sonority distance between these sounds is not enough for some speakers to", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3353, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aceb5ba1-416c-4ed2-b3f1-5c26bda77c6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "aceb5ba1-416c-4ed2-b3f1-5c26bda77c6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c93bf17-84c6-4767-918f-16133f678133", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4a1f6da9533e74f04f485bda626306aa9fc43064619f358ecebbf03f89c7da4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "maintain the clusters (cf Steriade 1982), which again is cured by epenthesis.\n\nIt is remarkable in this light that many speakers of English epenthesize \u0259\nbetween a diphthong and a following r or l, too.

(Such monophthongization\nis also possible, but not obligatory for most of the other diphthongs, as shown\nby the variant pronunciations.) The r itself at the end of these words is\nvariably present or absent in different varieties of English. We see that\nepenthesis always applies before r, but only after a subset of the diphthongs\nbefore l. Notably, it is only after diphthongs with a front offglide that we\nhave epenthesis before l. This distribution makes sense if we analyse diphthongs\nas vowel+consonant sequences. Thus it is the consonant clusters jl, as well as\njr and wr that induce epenthesis. We could argue that wl is more stable a\ncluster because its members are homorganic \u2014 at least for speakers who have a\nvelarized l. In any case, it is not easy to see what would force epenthesis\nbetween a vowel and a consonant, if diphthongs were seen as vowels. If, however,\nthey are analysed as a vowel and a consonant as here, then epenthesis is\nexpected because a glide and a following liquid are very close to each other in\nsonority.\n\n5 Counterarguments\nIf diphthongs are indeed sequences of a short vowel and a glide (a consonant),\nthen why is there an almost uniform opinion in the literature on English\nphonology that these sequences are diphthongs? There must be some reason other\nthan the phonotactic interdependence of the vowel and the glide, which, as we\nhave seen, is not necessarily relevant on the one hand, and is disappearing on\nthe other. We will now take a brief look at some further potential reasons.\n\n5.1 History and spelling\nMiddle English had seven long vowels, i\u02d0 e\u02d0 \u025b\u02d0 a\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0 o\u02d0 u\u02d0. The quality of these\nvowels changed considerably in the Great Vowel Shift, and they all became\ndiphthongs: aj ij ij/ej ej \u0259w uw aw, respectively. Diphthongs of Middle English\nhave either merged with these \u201cnew\u201d diphthongs (eg the ow of grow with the \u0254\u02d0 >\now/\u0259w of go), or monophthongized (eg the aw > o\u02d0 of thaw), or remained as is (eg\nthe oj of choice).\n\nEnglish spelling still reflects Middle English in many respects, so diphthongs\nare often spelled by a single vowel letter, in fact, only two diphthongs, oj and\naw, cannot be spelled in this way. Many Middle English long\u2013short alternations\ndeveloped into a diphthong\u2013short vowel alternation in current English: eg keep\nkijp\u2013kept, grave grejv\u2013gravity grav\u0259tij, mime majm\u2013mimic mimik, south saw\u03b8\u2013\nsouthern s\u0259\u00f0\u0259n, holy h\u0259wlij\u2013holiday holidej, fool fuwl\u2013folly folij, etc.\n\nBecause of this historical burden there is a strong tradition of calling\ndiphthongs \u201clong vowels\u201d: ie ej as \u201clong A\u201d, ij as \u201clong E\u201d, etc. With this\nbackground the reluctance of analysing these \u201cvowels\u201d as vowel+consonant\nsequences is hardly surprising.\n\n5.2 Stress patterns\nThere is some reason to believe that the location of word stress in English can\nbe calculated from segmental patterns.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3545, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ec9e38c-d5b4-4402-bff3-1ec9dbc5ff46": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ec9e38c-d5b4-4402-bff3-1ec9dbc5ff46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c50d705-890b-45d6-81cc-60a97f773d9a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a909c8a19a1eb052d62546da796c4f09b105e0e20bf535395e50248ab86b6f7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b13a6b23-b2b0-49ec-aa0f-9541cc27387f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb7c6e077232676e78e5d34b041a31c868b0897b4eac591f2cd4443dcc95ba95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Analysing diphthongs as VC (as opposed to VV) sequences influences stress-\ncalculating algorithms in three cases. Firstly, in verbs final VV and VC is\ndistinguished: the former is stressed, the latter is not (eg agree \u0259gr\u00edj vs\nhabit h\u00e1bit. In fact, this distinction was not clear even in the time of its\nstatement: word-final \u201clong U\u201d had to be listed as an exception (as in argue\n\u00e1\u02d0gjuw, continue k\u0259nt\u00ednjuw). In current English ij and \u0259w also occur in final\nposition in verbs without \u201cattracting\u201d stress (eg carry k\u00e1rij, follow f\u00f3l\u0259w).\nFurthermore, there are VC-final verbs whose final syllable is stressed (eg omit\n\u0259m\u00edt, rebel r\u0259b\u00e9l). Verbs that end in a diphthong followed by a consonant are\nstressed on their last syllable exactly like verbs that end in two consonants,\nso it makes no difference in this case if diphthongs are analysed as VC: both\nferment f\u0259m\u00e9nt and cremate kr\u0259m\u00e9jt are stressed on their ult.\n\nSecondly, Chomsky & Halle (1968: 72, 78) claim that a \u201clong vowel\u201d in the last\nsyllable of a word is always stressed. Thus, although polysyllabic nouns are not\nusually stressed on their ult \u2014 which is extrametrical, says Hayes (1982) \u2014,\nthey are when this syllable contains a long vowel: cf arcade a\u02d0k\u00e9jd vs stipend\nst\u00e1jpend. Burzio shows that \u201cthere is [\u2026] no reason to suppose that long vowels\nin final syllables are always stressed\u201d (1994: 48\u201352). The \u201cdiphthong\u201d in arcade\nis stressed like the VCC sequence in defence d\u0259f\u00e9ns and the VCC sequence in\nstipend is unstressed like the \u201cdiphthong\u201d (or, as claimed here, VCC sequence)\nin decade d\u00e9kejd.\n\nThirdly, nouns and adjectives seem to distinguish VV$ and V$C in their penult: a\n\u201cdiphthong\u201d is tautosyllabic, hence it attracts stress, but a vowel followed by\na heterosyllabic consonant does not. Since both parts of a diphthong belong to\nthe penult, but a single consonant belongs to the last syllable here, the penult\nis light in the latter case: cf European j\u00f3\u02d0r\u0259p\u00edj\u0259n vs regimen r\u00e9\u02a4im\u0259n. If the\nij in European were a VC sequence, one might argue, then onset maximization\nwould syllabify the j into the last syllable, therefore the CV structure of the\nlast two syllables of these two words would be the same (ij\u0259n and im\u0259n). Note,\nhowever, that there are plenty of words that have the same sequence in their\nlast two syllables, but are stressed on their antepenult (eg Cyclopean\nsajkl\u0259\u0301wpij\u0259n, scorpion sk\u00f3\u02d0pij\u0259n), what\u2019s more other words that have the latter\nsequence are stressed on their penult (eg persimmon p\u0259s\u00edm\u0259n).\n\nWe may conclude that \u201cstress rules\u201d cannot be used convincingly to argue for\nanalysing diphthongs either as \u201clong vowels\u201d or as VC sequences.\n\n5.3 \u201cIntervocalic\u201d lenition\nIn many accents of English consonants do not retain all their properties in\nintervocalic position.

What is crucial for us is the difference between\naccents C and D in (17). This contrast is manifested by New Zealand English\nBasilect (C) and Acrolect (D) flapping (Bye & de Lacy 2008: 195ff).\n\nWe contend that in accent D flapping occurs exclusively in intervocalic\nposition, whereas in accents A, B, and C it may also occur after consonants: the\nmore sonorous the consonant before the flapping site is, the more likely\nflapping is to occur. It is accent D that categorizes diphthongal offglides \u2014\nand the second half of long vowels too(!) \u2014 together with (other) consonants.\nThe importance of this pattern is that the difference between matter m\u00e1\u027e\u0259 and\nmitre m\u00e1jt\u0259 (*m\u00e1j\u027e\u0259) is easily captured if j is a consonant, like s in master\nm\u00e1st\u0259 (*m\u00e1s\u027e\u0259).\n\n5.4 \u201cGeminates\u201d\nThe last potential argument against VC diphthongs in English that we mention\nhere concerns the constraint on true, ie morpheme-internal, geminates (eg Harris\n1994: 18): English lacks this kind of consonant.

The list\nintends to be exhaustive.\n\n(18)\njj: dasyure, diuresis, maieutic, pyuria, Shijiazhuang, sukiyaki, Taiyuan, triune\nww: Beowulf, Hluhluwe, powwow\nSome of the words in (18) are arguably not monomorphemic (eg Beowulf, powwow),\nothers are not nativized (eg Shijiazhuang), yet others may be transcribed by jj\nbecause of their spelling, but pronounced with a single j (eg dasyure, diuresis,\netc), but most certainly none of these words occur with any significant\nfrequency in English.\n\nNow, it must be admitted that glide+glide sequences are not common in English\nanyway, we list nonidentical glide clusters in (19).\n\n(19)\njw: Awacs, Blawith, Chichewa, Ewok, Iwo, kiwi, pewit, Taiwan, Tewa\nwj: alleluia, bouillon, cocoyam, Gruyere, Kikuyu, thuya yoyo\nThe scarcity of such clusters may be blamed on the fact that there is very\nlittle sonority distance between these two consonants, but crucially the fact\nthat there are constraints here justifies the suspicion that these are consonant\nclusters.\n\n6 Long vowels\nWe do not intend to take a firm stand on the status of long vowels in this\npaper. The following observations seem to be worth pointing out though.\n\nIn accent D (New Zealand Acrolect) flapping occurs between two vowels only if\nthe first vowel is short: it occurs neither after diphthongs (eg mitre *m\u00e1j\u027e\u0259),\nnor after long vowels (eg martyr *m\u00e1\u02d0\u027e\u0259). We have argued that the absence of\nflapping after diphthongs is explainable if diphthongs are taken to be VC\nsequences, ie if a t is not in intervocalic position after a diphthongal\noffglide. If flapping also fails to occur after a long vowel then one may think\nthis is also because such a consonant is not between two vowels, ie a long vowel\nis also a vowel followed by a consonant.\n\nThe absurdity of this claim is lessened by two considerations: (i) most long", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3605, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8efddb29-361b-4421-93d1-8807a97386f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8efddb29-361b-4421-93d1-8807a97386f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8101db0-23bc-4c5c-bd17-9369ad78cf08", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f509b9a30264d4ab7a5fc8ab5a141ac2aab13837ce7e1d11e901165c2729156f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "vowels of current British English are the result of compensatory lengthening\naccompanying the loss of an earlier r (eg fort fo\u02d0t) or h (eg fought fo\u02d0t), (ii)\nthese two consonants and the length mark, \u02d0, are in complementary distribution.\n\nHowever, we do not need to assume that current British English fo\u02d0t is in fact\nfort or foht, it is enough to postulate that the second part of a long vowel is\nassociated to a consonantal position in the skeleton, assuming an autosegmental\nrepresentation. Thus the representation of o\u02d0 in English would not be that shown\nin (20a), but that shown in (20b).\n\n(20)\na.      V V             b.

This explains the lack of flapping in accent D.\n\nWe will use the symbol h to represent the vowel associated with a consonantal\nposition. Note that this is the standard practice in the case of prevocalic \u201ch\u201d:\nthe symbol h represents a sound that is phonetically a vowel, but phonologically\na consonant in transcriptions like hit, hen, hat, etc. Thus oh is used to\ntranscribe a long vowel which is linked to both a vocalic and a following\nconsonantal position. The second part of this entity is also phonetically a\nvowel, phonologically a consonant.\n\n7 Conclusions\nAnalysing diphthongs and long vowels as vowel+consonant sequences has a very\nradical consequence: the vowel inventory of current British English is reduced\nto six short vowels, namely, i e a o u and \u0259. Therefore the first column of the\nfollowing chart contains all the vowels of current British English. The rest of\nthe columns contain the same vowels followed by h, j, and w, respectively.\n\n(21)\ni       kit     ih      near ij         fleece         iw      bill\ne       dress eh        square          ej     face ew         bell\na       trap ah         start aj        price aw       mouth\no       lot     oh      north oj        choice         ow      ball\nu       foot uh         cure uj         (goose)        uw      goose(/bull)\n\u0259       strut \u0259h        nurse \u0259j        (goat)         \u0259w      goat(/dull)\nOf the six vowels only one, unstressed \u0259 may occur word finally. None of the\nvowels may occur before another vowel, ie there is no hiatus in English as\nanalysed here.\n\nThree of the six vowels may occur in an unstressed syllable: \u0259, i, and u. Of\nthese unstressed u is always followed by w (eg argue \u00e1hgjuw). Unstressed \u0259 and i\nare in near complementary distribution with i occurring typically before \u201ccoda\u201d\nj, \u02a4, \u02a7, and \u014b (eg carry k\u00e1rij, carriage k\u00e1ri\u02a4, ostrich \u00f3stri\u02a7, gosling g\u00f3zli\u014b)\nand \u0259 in other positions. These two unstressed vowels are freely variable in\nmany positions.\n\nThe view of the vowel system of current British English presented above is\nsignificantly simpler than the currently accepted alternatives, it is\nnevertheless phonologically tenable in all respects we have had the chance to\nexamine up to now.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2998, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67e0d2d9-cc9c-4c86-8adc-63fcad4cf026": {"__data__": {"id_": "67e0d2d9-cc9c-4c86-8adc-63fcad4cf026", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b29240f-8da2-41bb-ad4f-e128ba29b77f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f545b3b519cc5d9eefd3a70ce66d7d9693dba9024b32bdc9b7c009a7af0fa05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "BBN\u2013ANG\u2013243 Phonological Analysis #3\nTHE VOWEL INVENTORY OF BRITISH ENGLISH\nZolt\u00e1n G.

Author(s)\n\n              ABSTRACT\n              Following Trager & Bloch (1941), I argue that diphthongs in English are short vowels followed by a glide,\n              that is, a consonant (Szigetv ari 2016). In the present paper, I bring further evidence for this claim, based on\n              the distribution of unstressed vowels in British English.\n\n              KEYWORDS\n              vowel inventory, unstressed vowels, diphthongs, unstressability scale, British English\n\n              Numerous descriptions of the vowel systems of different Englishes have been proposed during\n              the past centuries. Most of these descriptions include a group of vowels that are analysed as\n              diphthongs. This group comprises several sets that are variably seen as diphthongs or as\n              monophthongs. These sets are shown in (1).\n\n(1)       Sets of vowels potentially categorized as diphthongs in English\n          a.     PRICE, MOUTH, CHOICE\n          b.     FACE, GOAT\n          c.

Sweet (1900) transcribes FLEECE and GOOSE as [\ufb02ijs] and [guws], it is only Jones (1917)\n                                 who (wrongly, as I will argue) alters the British tradition, and introduces the currently prevalent\n                                 monophthongal symbols [i] and [u] for the vowels in (1c). American accounts again vary, the\u02d0    \u02d0\n                                 typical case is to lump the vowels in (1b) and (1c) together, either as diphthongs ([ey], [ow];\n                                 [iy], [uw]) or as (tense) monophthongs ([e], [o]; [i], [u], respectively). The vowels of the last\n                                 group, (1d), are vowel\u00fe[r] sequences in rhotic American English, occasionally centring\n                                 diphthongs. In British English they were diphthongs at the beginning of the last century, but\n                                 have all gradually monophthongized. This is re\ufb02ected in the transcription of                                                                                 FORCE  by Jones\n                                 (1917): [f\u0254 s] (vs. Sweet\u2019s [f\u0254\u0259s]); CURE and SQUARE by Upton (1995): [kj\u0254 ] (vs. Gimson\u2019s [kj\u028a\u0259],\u02d0                                                      \u02d0\n                                 1962; already mentioned in Jones 1917) and [skw\u025b\u02d0] (vs. Gimson\u2019s [skwe\u0259]), and also                                                                                    NEAR   by\n                                 Lindsey (2012a, 2019): [n\u026a\u02d0] (vs. Upton\u2019s [n\u026a\u0259]).

THE VOWEL INVENTORY OF BRITISH ENGLISH (BRE)\n                                 The vowel inventory of English is often split into tense and lax vowels. This distinction reflects\n                                 that some vowels can be traced back to Middle English long vowels and diphthongs (these are\n                                 tense), others to Middle English short vowels (these are lax). However, in nonrhotic British\n                                 English, where compensatory lengthening ensuing the loss of historical [r] and the later loss of\n                                 [\u0259] produced long vowels merging these two categories (e.g., far [far] > [fa]; \ufb01re [fajr] > [faj\u0259r] >\u02d0\n                                 [faj\u0259] > [fa\u0259] > [fa]), the tense vs. lax split is partly merged, and so it is not meaningful any\u02d0\n                                 more.\n                                          Instead, we will classify vowels by the environments in which they occur. Some vowels may\n                                 only occur before a consonant, others also word finally, and yet others in any position, including\n                                 prevocalic position.

The second set, the members of which are listed in (2b),\n                                  are referred to as R vowels by Kreidler (1989). In the present analysis they are all                                                                                                                                                                                                  \u201clong\u201d\n                                  monophthongs. The last set contains vowels that may occur in all three environments, (2c).\n                                  Following Trubetzkoy (1968) this set will be called free vowels. They are considered to be\n                                  diphthongs by most analysts (or not, as we have seen above), although there are notable ex-\n                                  ceptions, like Batchelor (1809),6 Trager & Bloch (1941); Trager & Smith (1957), who take these\n                                  sequences to be a short vowel followed by a glide, an analysis I support with some evidence in\n                                  this paper.\n                                              Since the tense\u2013lax contrast does not characterize British English, there is no reason to\n                                  distinguish vowel symbols along this dimension. Accordingly and also for the sake of simplicity,\n                                  I will use the six vowel symbols [i e a \u0259 o u] as in (3), although \u201clax\u201d symbols like [\u026a \u00ab \u0254 \u028a], or\n                                  distinct front and back [a                                                                 \u0251\u02d0], or a centralized symbol [\u0289] for the last vowel of each category,\n                                  would perhaps be more appropriate if our aim were to be phonetically precise.\n\n                                  (3)                        The vowels of BrE\n                                                             a.             checked vowels:                                         KIT        [i], DRESS [e], TRAP [a],                                               STRUT  [\u0259], LOT [o], FOOT [u]\n                                                             b.

DIPHTHONG OR VC/CV?\nA diphthong is the combination of a vowel and an adjacent glide (or, perhaps schwa) into what\nis considered as one unit. What kind of unit this is is not clear: it is usually not a segment in the\nautosegmental sense, since it consists of two skeletal slots with melody associated to each. The\nliterature also mentions so-called light (monomoraic) diphthongs, which are monosegmental\n(linked to a single skeletal slot, Kaye 1989, 128), but their status is even less clear. Whether a\nvowel\u00feglide or glide\u00fevowel sequence is a diphthong is a question that phonetics cannot answer,\nthis is a matter of phonological analysis, and accordingly this is a language-speci\ufb01c issue. It may\nwell happen that a vowel\u00feglide or glide\u00fevowel sequence is a diphthong in some variety of a\nlanguage, but not in another variety.\n     It can even be argued that the status of a glide\u00fevowel sequence may differ from word to word.\nWith respect to article selection, the French word [jatys] \u2018hiatus\u2019, for example, behaves as a vowel-\ninitial word: it selects the vowelless form of the singular de\ufb01nite article, [ljatys],8 which is typical of\nwords that begin with a vowel. The beginning of the word [jau\u0281t] \u2018yoghurt\u2019 is rather similar, yet it\nselects the vowelful form of the singular de\ufb01nite article, like consonant-initial words do: [l\u0259jau\u0281t].\nDigging a bit deeper, we \ufb01nd some facts that may make us wary. On the one hand, [jatys] has an\nalternative form [iatys], which begins with a \u201creal\u201d vowel, but [jau\u0281t] does not have such an alternative\nform. Yet [wat] \u2018watt\u2019 selects the vowelful singular de\ufb01nite article [l\u0259wat], while [wat] \u2018cotton\u2019 may also\nselect the vowelless allomorph, [lwat], although the latter word has no vowel-initial variant,p[uat]. On\nthe other hand, there exist numerous French words that begin with a \u201creal\u201d vowel, and yet select the\npreconsonantal, vowelful variant of the singular de\ufb01nite article: for example, [\u025bn] \u2018hatred\u2019, [la\u025bn]. Many\n(though not all) of these words have a [h]-initial etymon: [\u025bn], for example, is a descendant of the\nsame Proto-Germanic word as English hate, which did indeed begin with a consonant.\n     English is less variable in this respect. Vowel-initial words select the consonantful variant of\nthe indefinite article9        (an apple), consonant-initial words select the consonantless variant (a\npear). This distribution holds even in words that are variable: we have a hen                               for speakers who\npronounce hen         as [hen], but      an hen     for those who pronounce it as [en].\n     With its phonetically stable article selection, English provides us with a criterion for ana-\nlysing   \u201cdiphthongs\u201d        that begin with the glide. Words like                   yak   or  wax pan wax \ufb01gure. In fact,cannot begin with a\ndiphthong, because they do not behave like vowel-initial words:pan yak,\nno glide\u00fevowel sequence can be analysed as a diphthong in English: even words that were\nhistorically vowel initial behave as (5 are) consonant initial today when they begin with a glide\n(e.g., a ewe, a eulogy, a unit, a Uyghur). 10 That is, the article test neatly distinguishes consonant-\nand vowel-initial words in English, and uniformly categorizes glides with consonants and,\nconsequently, glide\u00fevowel sequences as clusters, not diphthongs.\n\n 8 The form [l\u0259jatys] is considered uneducated.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3727, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "828ad770-d0f1-4254-837f-b90c99421cb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "828ad770-d0f1-4254-837f-b90c99421cb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "55a44e50-8352-492f-8b38-d4c6a8351088", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d254fc75ee2f81c12280af98641df2cf224ce84d204c7423dec8d650aca96a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4eead1f0-b219-4e20-af94-3ace1aa10976", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8bdfbf88d50aca5cc68599dbb3a83e87c99839fc73b1ba2e2666cafcff3c4fe0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Words like                   yak   or  wax pan wax \ufb01gure.

The distributions of the allomorphs of the past\ntense ([d]     \u223c   [id]) and the nominal plural suf\ufb01x ([z]               \u223c   [iz]) do not distinguish between vowels\nand consonants, but between some set of consonants (alveolar plosives and sibilants, respec-\ntively) and the set comprising all other consonants and vowels. The ordinal suf\ufb01x [q] has a\nvowelful allomorph only after [ij] (as in twentieth [twentij\u0259q]), but not after any other segment,\nbe it a vowel (as in fourth [fo:q]) or any consonant (as in tenth                          [tenq], eighth      [ejtq]) or con-\nsonant cluster (as in thousandth [qawz\u0259ndq] or sixth [siksq]). So there is no suf\ufb01x test in English\nfor separating vowel- and consonant-\ufb01nal words.\n     In fact, not even enclitics make this distinction. It is only enclitics that have a nonsyllabic\nallomorph that are possible candidates for the test. These all begin with a vowel or a glide in\ntheir full allomorph. Of them, and will not do, since \u2018n\u2019 is always syllabic ([\u0259n] or [n]). Likewise$\nare [\u0259] also only has a syllabic allomorph. 11 The candidates that remain are listed in (4).\n(4)        Nonsyllabic enclitics of English\n           a.    has [h\u0259z], is     [iz]  \u223c   \u2019s [z]\n           b.    had   [h\u0259d], would [w\u0259d]          \u223c   \u2019d [d]\n           c.    have [h\u0259v]      \u223c   \u2019ve  [v]\n           d.    will [wil]    \u223c   \u2019ll [l]\n           e.    am [\u0259m]       \u223c  \u2019m   [m]\n\nJust like the homophonous suffixes, the clitics [z] and [d], (4a\u2013b), are not sensitive to the\ndistinction between vowels and consonants, so they cannot be used as a test. The distribution of\n[m], (4e), is very limited (it occurs only in I\u2019m [ajm]                \u223c   [am]), so it is also useless for our purpose.\n     This leaves us with two clitics, have [v] 12 and will [l]. English words regularly do not end in a\nchecked vowel, but unstressed function words may do so, providing us with examples of the two\nrelevant nonsyllabic clitics after a (checked) vowel. The stressed variant of the same pronouns\nend in a free vowel or a glide, depending on the analysis.

This distribution mirrors monomorphemic word-\ufb01nal clusters:\nboth [jv] and [wv] occur (e.g.,           eve, cave, dive, cove, move), [jl] is subject to epenthesis (e.g.,                 \ufb01le\n[faj\u0259l], fail [fej\u0259l], etc.), [wl] is variable (e.g., owl, cool).\n    The     distribution      of  the   nonsyllabic       allomorphs       of   enclitics    thus    allows    for   both    in-\nterpretations of these sequences, therefore there seems to be no conclusive evidence for ana-\nlysing these sequences either as diphthongs or as vowel\u00feconsonant sequences. In any case, we\ndid not    \ufb01nd obvious evidence for taking them to be diphthongs.\n\n3. STRESSED AND UNSTRESSED VOWELS\nVowel quality in English is related to stress. The general wisdom is that one vowel, schwa, only\noccurs unstressed, the other vowels may either be stressed or unstressed. There is some\nconfusion about the use of the term \u201cstress\u201d, however. In many descriptions of English, this term\nis used synonymously with accent.13 It is certainly true that any vowel may occur without accent\nin English, but if we avoid the con\ufb02ation of \u201cstress\u201d and \u201caccent\u201d, then a stressed vowel will be\nidentical to a full vowel (and an unstressed vowel to a reduced vowel). In this terminology,\nwhich is what I follow in this paper, it is not the case that any vowel may be unstressed in\nEnglish. In fact, all vowels in the inventory introduced in (3) occur stressed, but only a subset of\nthat inventory occurs unstressed.\n    The set of reduced (or unstressed) vowels includes schwa and two further vowels, KIT and\nFOOT , transcribed as [i] and [u], respectively, by Jones (1917), and as [\u026a] and [\u028a] by Gimson\n(1962). The second vowel in each of the following words is unstressed and together they\nillustrate all the possibilities:       comet     [k om\u0259t],   comic    [k omik],    communal [k omjun\u0259l]. All three\nvowels occur preconsonantally, as in these examples.\n    Word finally FOOT and GOOSE were in free variation earlier, with the latter gaining the upper\nhand. Jones transcribes value as [\u02c8v\u00e6lju] with the alternant [-ju] added in brackets, implying it is\u02d0\nthe less frequent form (1917, xx), furthermore, he adds that for many words the variant with the\nshort vowel is available, but not indicated in the dictionary (1917, xxx). We \ufb01nd this solution all\nthe way up to the 14th edition (Gimson 1977).

Since these symbols only occur in unstressed position, that is,\n                      they represent reduced vowels, they could be called schwee and schwoo, respectively (Lindsey\n                      2012b). Word \ufb01nally Wells does not apply schwoo, since, as we have noted above, VALUE -tensing\n                      has completed in standard British English in this position. It is important to emphasize that [i]\n                      and [u] are not members of the vowel inventory, they are transcriptional abbreviations or, from\n                      a different point of view, archiphonemes.\n                              Thus in current British English the set of reduced vowels (the vowels that may occur in\n                      unstressed position) seems to have increased, in addition to schwa,                                                                                  KIT , and FOOT , it now also\n                      includes FLEECE and                          GOOSE . In fact, there is a sixth member of this set:                                                         GOAT . Jones claims that\n                      [ou] has an allophone [o]                                  \u201cin certain unstressed positions\u201d                                        (1917, xxxv). This vowel is repre-\n                      sented by [ou], the italicized offglide is                                                 \u201coptional\u201d. It is most common before a consonant,\n                      especially at the end of what looks like a learned pre\ufb01x, but elsewhere too: both positions are\n                      exempli\ufb01ed by automobile                                    [\u02c8 \u0254toumoubil]. 16 \u02d0       \u02d0           We also \ufb01nd this symbol before a vowel (Genoa\n                      [\u02c8d\u0292enou\u0259]). 17 Interestingly, the word-\ufb01nal occurrence of this alternation is rather rare, Jones\n                      indicates it in                 fellow, but not arrow, borrow, hallow, window unless followed by a vowel-initial\n                      suf\ufb01x or in a compound:                                     fellow         [\u02c8felou] vs.              arrow           [\u02c8\u00e6rou] vs.               arrowy           [\u02c8\u00e6roui],            arrow-head\n                      [\u02c8\u00e6rouhed].\n                              British English underwent a vowel change that is relevant from our point of view,                                                                                                        GOAT -\n                      fronting (or advancement, Wells 1982, 237). The shift of the \ufb01rst part of earlier [ou] into [\u0259u] is\n                      already mentioned by Jones (1917), but it is given graphical recognition only much later by\n                      Gimson (1962), as [\u0259\u028a], and Jones (1967), as [\u0259u]. With this change, the marginal reduced vowel\n                      [o], which was in free variation with [\u0259], has disappeared from dictionaries. It has been replaced\n                      by the canonical reduced vowel, [\u0259].\n                              As a result, in current British English we have six reduced vowels. Three of the six checked\n                      vowels may occur in unstressed position:                                                     KIT     ([i]),      STRUT         ([\u0259]), and            FOOT         ([u]); and three free\n                      vowels may also occur here: FLEECE ([ij]), GOAT ([\u0259w]), and GOOSE ([uw]).\n                              None of the R vowels, that is, the long monophthongs, may occur unstressed. This follows\n                      from universal tendencies of stressability. For example, Hayes claims that \u201cCV counts as a light\n                      syllable.

Note that [o] contrasts graphically with LOT , which is [\u0254].

Because of this, what we need is the opposite of the stressability scale, that is, an\n\u201cunstressability\u201d                                                                     scale. This is given in (7).\n\n(7)                                    The unstressability scale\n                                       V$ > VC$ > VV$\n\nThe scale shows that the R vowels (VV) are the least unstressable vowels, and indeed, in English\nthey only occur stressed. We have mentioned above that free vowel\u00feschwa sequences alternate\nwith R vowels. However, this only occurs in stressed position, so idea may be [ajd\u0131\u02d0 ], but India\nmay not be p ndi], secure may be [sikj ], but jaguar may not be p[d\u0292a\u0261ju].

Not all\nchecked vowels and not all free vowels may occur unstressed. Let us first look at the six checked\nvowels. They may be arranged in the format shown in (8).\n\n(8)                                    The checked vowels\n                                       \u201cnonlow\u201d                                                           i                  \u0259                   u                     unstressable\n                                       \u201cnonhigh\u201d                                                          e                  a                   o                     not unstressable\n\nIn defence of the indeterminate labels \u201cnonlow\u201d and \u201cnonhigh\u201d it must be noted that the vowels\nof the top line are not necessarily high, but they are certainly not low. Similarly, those of the\nbottom line are not all low, but certainly none of them is high. Kenstowicz (1997) shows that in\nsome languages the stressability scale does not only involve quantity, but also quality. Put simply\nthe more sonorous, that is, the more open a vowel, the more stressable it is. This is exactly what\nwe \ufb01nd in English, too: the closer, less sonorous vowel of each pair, [i], [\u0259], and [u], may occur\nunstressed, the opener, more sonorous ones, [e], [a], and [o], may not. So opener vowels are less\n\u201cunstressable\u201d than closer ones. More concretely, they are not unstressable, while closer ones are.\nThus the fact that [i], [\u0259], and [u] may occur in unstressed position in English, while [e], [a], and\n[o] may not follows from universals of language.\n                However, we have seen that some of the free vowels, traditionally classified as diphthongs,\nmay also occur in unstressed position. We are going to examine them in the next section.\n\n4. UNSTRESSED FREE VOWELS\nWe have seen that                                                                                 HAPPY -tensing is responsible for the creation of a word-\ufb01nal and prevocalic\nunstressed free vowel,                                                                                             FLEECE .

But there are further arguments for this analysis.\n                  In light of the unstressability scale of (7), HAPPY -tensing is a suspicious phenomenon. Why\nshould an unstressed light syllable become heavy? The vowel in an unstressed syllable is ex-\npected to become \u201csimpler\u201d, shorter, closer, but not longer or a diphthong. I argue that                                                                                                                                                                                                 HAPPY -\ntensing is not the fortition of a vowel, rather it is the consequence of the generalization of a\nphonotactic constraint of English.\n                  In the interpretation advocated in this paper, the input of this change is [i] and the output is\n[ij]. This change is the \u201cfortition\u201d of the vowel, only if [ij] is a diphthong, that is, a single unit. If,\nhowever, it is the short vowel, [i], followed by a consonant, [j], then this change is the epenthesis\nof a consonant. Word \ufb01nally this consonant is epenthesized because word-\ufb01nal short vowels are\ndispreferred in English. Prevocalically, this consonant is epenthesized because prevocalic vowels\n(that is, hiatus) are also strongly dispreferred in English.\n                  We have seen that stressed short vowels do not occur either word finally or prevocalically. In\nthe accent described by Jones and Gimson, the unstressed short vowels [i] and [u] could occur in\nthese positions:                                                                     happy [h api],                               India      [ ndi\u0259], value \u0131                       [v alju], jaguar [d\u0292 \u0261ju\u0259], and unstressed [\u0259]a\ncan occur word \ufb01nally, but not prevocalically. The constraint against short vowels in word-\ufb01nal\nand prevocalic position has been generalized to unstressed position, which triggers the insertion\n(or, in the case of [uw], the retention) of the glide after these two short unstressed vowels. Most\nimportantly, in neither case does this change make the syllable heavy, which would entail that it\nis less unstressable. It is well-known that word-\ufb01nal consonants are not moraic in English, 19 so\nthe glide does not add to the weight of the \ufb01nal syllable in the changes from [h api] to [h apij] or\n[v alju] to [v aljuw]. The glide that appears between two vowels, as in the changes from [ ndi\u0259] to\u0131\n[ ndij\u0259] or [d\u0292 \u0261ju\u0259] to [d\u0292 \u0261juw\u0259], is an onset, hence it does not contribute to weight either.\n                                                                                                \u0131a                             a\nThat is, the unstressed syllables involved in HAPPY -tensing and VALUE -tensing remain light, hence\nfully unstressable.\n                  The appearance of a [j] and [w] after [i] and [u] in unstressed word-final and prevocalic\nposition is thus the result of the extension of the constraint against short vowels in these po-\nsitions. However, only if we analyse these two glides as consonants will they not contribute to\nthe weight of the unstressed syllables they seem to appear in.\n                  On several occasions I have hinted at the fact that while in                                                                                                                                                                   HAPPY -tensing a short vowel\nturned into a diphthong, or rather, as we now see, a short vowel, [i], followed by a consonant, [j],\n\n19Views differ as to how the nonmoraicity of these consonants is to be accounted for, but here we do not have to delve\n       into details.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Unauthenticated | Downloaded 11/13/24 01:02 PM UTC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5099, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da542b59-e105-4018-91fa-6b0b9470833c": {"__data__": {"id_": "da542b59-e105-4018-91fa-6b0b9470833c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c2844e3-ce0e-44fe-9ed7-672b376c68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5332f9eb081fcc4e6ce4692475c8a759c00ac59a727a184feeab673951b5111e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Acta Linguistica Academica 69 (2022) 1, 4\u201316\n                                                                                                                            13\nin VALUE -tensing it is a diphthong, that is, the short vowel [u] followed by the consonant [w] that\ndid not lose its glide. The same holds for unstressed GOAT : this vowel is [\u0259w] (or, rather, [ow])\nhistorically, and it may lose its [w]. But this loss may never occur prevocalically, and even word\n\ufb01nally, it is a rare event (e.g.,         fellow   [f \u0259w] el  \u223c   [f \u0259]). However, both unstressed el            GOOSE    and\nunstressed GOAT may lose their glide before a consonant.

In fact, it is\nprobably universally true that the distribution of vowels may be curtailed word finally or pre-\nvocalically, but not preconsonantally.21 Yet, unstressed FLEECE fails to occur in this position and\nunstressed GOOSE and GOAT also may or must lose their offglide in preconsonantal position. Why\nshould that be so?\n    I argue that this follows from the unstressability scale presented in (7). The three                               \u201cdiph-\nthongs\u201d    [ij], [\u0259w], and [uw] are heavy before a consonant, but light before a vowel and word\n\ufb01nally only if they are vowel\u00feconsonant sequences. Since the strings under discussion are ex-\npected to be high on the unstressability scale, but diphthongs, which are VV, are at the bottom\nof that scale, they had better not be analysed as diphthongs.\n\n5. ALTERNATIONS IN UNSTRESSED POSITION\nAlternations of vowels are very common in unstressed position in English. The tendency is for\nboth [i] and [u] to become [\u0259].

The coronal [n], for example, does not inhibit the preceding unstressed\nvowel vowel ending up as schwa: fortune [f \u02d0tuwn] o            \u0283        \u223c   [f t\u0259n].o\u02d0\u0283\n     If unstressed [ij] and [uw] are [i] and [u] followed by the glides [j] and [w], respectively, as\nargued here, their stability follows from the palatal and labial consonant following the unstressed\nvowel.\n\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nI argue that there are several reasons to analyse unstressed FLEECE, GOAT , and GOOSE as KIT, STRUT ,\nand FOOT , respectively, followed by the consonant [j] in the \ufb01rst case, and the consonant [w] in\nthe latter two. On the other hand, there is no reason to take these sequences to be diphthongs:\nwe have seen that suf\ufb01xes or clitics do not provide evidence for such an analysis. In fact, if they\nare taken to be diphthongs, then we encounter a rather unexpected vowel strengthening in\nunstressed position (known as HAPPY -tensing). In Szigetv ari (2016), I look at English vowels in\nstressed position too and come to the same result. In the present paper, I survey evidence\nprovided by these vowels in unstressed position. The reasons for analysing unstressed [ij], [\u0259w],\nand [uw] as VC, not as VV are the following:\n1. the \ufb01rst parts of [ij], [\u0259w], and [uw] are identical to the three unstressable short vowels, [i],\n    [\u0259], and [u];\n2. the change of word-\ufb01nal and prevocalic [i] into [ij] in unstressed position makes sense only if\n    [ij] is VC;\n3. the optional or obligatory loss of [w] from unstressed [\u0259w] and [uw] in preconsonantal\n    position makes sense if they are VC;\n4. the stability of [i] and [u] before the homorganic glides [j] and [w] is parallelled by the\n    stability of the same unstressed vowels before a homorganic consonant.\n\n22There are very few examples of words ending in unstressed [i\u0261]. It is not even obvious if the [i] in Danzig is indeed\n  unstressed. Of course, if it is stressed that explains its failure to alternate with schwa.\n23Jones (1917, 1967), and other editions of EPD in between mention the alternant [v olj\u0259m], but Wells (1990) does not.\n                                                                                        Unauthenticated | Downloaded 11/13/24 01:02 PM UTC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3173, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72d2c081-e284-4581-b8b1-8d4e51e1bd90": {"__data__": {"id_": "72d2c081-e284-4581-b8b1-8d4e51e1bd90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b27a045-e0ea-4b5d-8a37-24168077be23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6a65c522f1f9fc03366ff78fc05194e0b184a603a4bd4a29b5773edc24e31bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Acta Linguistica Academica 69 (2022) 1, 4\u201316                                                                                      15\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nMy work is supported by NKFIH #119863.

The transcription system used in this chapter is the \u201cGimson IPA\u201d (and not \u201cCUBE\u201d,\nsee http://seas3.elte.hu/cube/accent.html). Most importantly, stress is indicated by vertical\nlines before the stressed syllable (primary stress: \u02c8, secondary stress: \u02cc). For example, the\nGimson IPA transcription of reformation is /\u02ccref\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n/ (CUBE: /r\u025b\u0301f\u0259m\u025b\u0301j\u0283\u0259n/).\nThis chapter was part of a former textbook released in 2013: Phonological Analysis.

WHAT IS PROSODY?\nProsody in linguistics means the study of stress, rhythm and intonation in units larger than the\nword. The elements of prosody are also called suprasegmentals because they appear \u201cabove\u201d\nthe segments.\n      Stress means pronouncing the syllable louder than others. Intonation, on the other hand,\nmeans the \u201cmelody\u201d \u2013 falling or rising \u2013 with which the sentence is spoken. Observe how we\ncan change one without changing the other:\n                                         (1)                                                   (2)\n                           Main stress on last word                                 Main stress earlier\n  (a) Falling     (1a)                                                (2a)\n  intonation       She \u2032spent a \u2032year in the  forest.                 She \u2032spent a  YEAR in the forest.\n  (b) Rising      (1b)                                                (2b)\n  intonation      \u2032Did she \u2032spend a \u2032year in the  forest?             \u2032Did she \u2032spend a  YEAR in the forest?\n\nAll combinations exist, proving that stress and intonation are independent variables, both hav\u2011\ning distinctive (contrastive, \u201cphonemic\u201d) value.\n          Even  though  italics  and  punctuation  may  represent  some  prosodic  features,  it  often\nhappens that the same written sentence can be spoken with differing stress or intonation pat\u2011\nterns. Ordinary spelling can only express some features of prosody, e.g.\n          She spent a year in the forest!  (emphatic stress on  year)\n\n                           7.2. THE END-WEIGHT PRINCIPLE\nIt is a general rule of English that if there is a sequence of equal stresses, the last must become\nthe  strongest.  The  prosodic  \u201cweight\u201d of an utterance must  be  at  the  end:  this  is  the  End\u2011\nWeight Principle. Observe the examples:\n      new b\u00f3ok                                  Amanda C\u00f3llinder                       sit d\u00f3wn\n      considerable exp\u00e9nses                     utterly destr\u00factive                    he criticized \u00e9verything\nUnstressable function words (printed here in italics) do not count:\n      right in fr\u00f3nt of you \u2013 John dr\u00e1nk some \u2013 what I l\u00f3ok for \u2013 Mary couldn\u2019t d\u00f3 it for me\nLonger  stretches  of  speech  also  obey  the  End\u2011Weight  Principle.  The  last  (and  therefore\nstrongest!) stress is called the tonic. In the following sentence the tonic is underlined:\n      The children managed to carry the suitcases as far as the edge of the r\u00f3undabout.\nThe End\u2011Weight Principle is satisfied through a Tonic Assignment Rule:\n\nTonic Assignment Rule\n      1 1 \u2192 2 1                        =  of  several  primary  stresses,  downgrade  each  to  secondary,\n                                       except the last, which will be the tonic.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2885, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27b37ad9-8df5-4aec-927e-f69e7ec245ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "27b37ad9-8df5-4aec-927e-f69e7ec245ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7177a704-de1f-4d6e-a1f2-c88b8adac2fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d93172aab1b78285c6ebee37c3d64153e499a60fb3305c39650803d35aa0dd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                                   3\n\nExample:    1\n                                1           1        1       \u2192         2              2            2        1\n               Rachel was happy to cycle home                        Rachel was happy to cycle home\n\nThe same mechanism is at work in many compounds:\n    1            1      \u2192      2            1                1            1        1     \u2192 2                2      1\nphoto montage                 photomontage                 second world war                 Second World War\n\nIt  follows  that  the  \u201csecondariness\u201d  of  secondary  stress  is  predictable:  a  secondary  stress  is\nactually a stress which is followed by another stress and has therefore been downgraded. Sec\u2011\nondary stress is thus an \u201callophone\u201d of primary stress. Lexically, we may represent words like\nreformation, satisfactory, sardine with two equal \u201cprimary\u201d stresses:\n          //\u02c8ref\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n//             //\u02c8s\u00e6t\u026as\u02c8f\u00e6kt\u0259ri//            //\u02c8s\u0251:\u02c8di:n//\nbecause the Tonic Assignment Rule will turn the first stress into secondary anyway:\n          /\u02ccref\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n/               /\u02ccs\u00e6t\u026as\u02c8f\u00e6kt\u0259ri/              /\u02ccs\u0251:\u02c8di:n/\n\nWe conclude that primary and secondary stress in an allophonic relationship (complementary\ndistribution), and can be seen as two realizations of the same thing: stress (or \u201cmajor stress\u201d)\n\n7.2.1. Stress Degrees in connected speech\nThe effects of the End\u2011Weight Principle are well known in the analysis of word stress:\n\u2013 if a word has two (rarely three) stresses, the last must be the primary, the one(s) before it\nsecondary. Consequently, there cannot be a secondary after the primary. 1\n\u2013 strong-unstressed  syllables  (f\u00f3rmat  /\u2011m\u00e6t/, dir\u00e9ct  /da\u026a\u2011/)  are  also  called  \u201ctertiary-\nstressed\u201d because their vowel does not reduce (as it would in completely unstressed syllables\nlike  s\u00e1lad  /\u2011l\u0259d/ or \u00d3xford  /\u2011f\u0259d/). From the prosodic point of view, however, 3ry  and  zero\nstresses do not count as stresses because the End\u2011Weight Principle does not \u201csee\u201d them: they\ncan never become 1ry\u2011stressed.\n      We conclude that  in prosody there are only two  phonologically  relevant  stress degrees:\nstressed (1ry or 2ry) and unstressed (3ry or zero).\n\nSTRESS DEGREES\n      example             urbanization            urbanization             urbanization            urbanization\n      (underlined)        /\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/        /\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/         /\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/  /\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/\n      word\u2011level:            primary str.           secondary str.            tertiary str.             zero str.\n      prosodic:                         s t r e s s e d                               u n s t r e s s e d\n                                    (= major\u2011stressed)                         (strong)                  (weak)\n\nWe  shall  occasionally  mention  (and  indicate)  secondary  stress,  but  generally  we  shall  just\nspeak of stressed  and unstressed syllables \u2013 or,  more simply, stressed and unstressed words\n(meaning that their primary\u2011stressable syllable is stressed or unstressed).\n1 In transcription, it is customary to use a secondary\u2011stress mark on the originally stressed (now terti\u2011\n  ary\u2011stressed) syllable of the second element if it is longer than one syllable: f\u00edre alarm /0faI\u0259r \u0259\u02ccl\u00e1:m/.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3342, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f5884ed-d16d-481a-8ace-85aee56e8088": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f5884ed-d16d-481a-8ace-85aee56e8088", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21246449-d45b-43c8-ae7f-32df83370824", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68e23eeee08232aeaad3ebab39ab596cc4c393378635a38298d04c2409441a68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                              4\n\n\n\n                                    7.3. COMPOUND WORDS\n\nA compound is a lexical unit (a lexeme) made up of two or more free stems (= words), e.g.\ngr\u00e9enhouse, to ill-tr\u00e9at, car ferry, unemployment benefit. Compounds usually have a special\u2011\nized meaning: a bl\u00e1ckbird is a special type of bird, not any bird that is black. Compounds be\u2011\nhave as units from the point of view of grammar (syntactically) and meaning (semantically).\n    From a phonological point of view there are two types of compound:\n       initially-stressed compounds, pattern  #  1  #  3  #\n         primary stress on the first element: gr\u00e9enhouse, c\u00e1r ferry, comp\u00fater virus\n       finally-stressed compounds, pattern #  2  #  1  #\n         primary stress on the second element: trade \u00fanion, fruit s\u00e1lad, Victoria St\u00e1tion\nThe type depends on the syntactic relationship between the two elements, their frequency, or\ndegree of lexicalization. The meaning or communicative \u201cimportance\u201d of the elements is not\ndecisive.\n      The  spelling  of  compounds  in  English  is  not  consistent.  Some  are  written  as  one  word\n(gr\u00e9enhouse),  some  with  a  hyphen  (w\u00f2rd-f\u00ednal),  but  the  majority  are  written  as  two  words\n(c\u00e1r ferry, ge\u00f3graphy teacher, d\u00f2uble ch\u00edn). The latter may be called \u201cinvisible compounds\u201d,\nsince the spelling does not show that they are compounds.2\n      When two words are just an ordinary phrase (new book) and not a compound, both ele\u2011\nments are stressed, the second has the primary stress according to the End\u2011Weight Principle.\nObserve the examples, where (a) and (b) have the same stress pattern,  while (b) and (c) are\ncompounds:\n      a. (We are using a) n\u00e9w  b\u00f3ok.                      \u2013 phrase; finally\u2011stressed by End\u2011Weight Princ.\n      b. (I\u2019ll make some) fruit  s\u00e1lad.                   \u2013 compound, finally\u2011stressed\n      c. (We drove to the)  c\u00e1r ferry.                    \u2013 compound, initially\u2011stressed\n7.3.1. Initially-stressed compounds\nThese sound like one word: the first element carries the stress. This pattern is the same as in\nHungarian,  German,  and  many  languages  (e.g.  telefonn\u00e9vjegyz\u00e9k).  The  second  element  is\ndowngraded to 3ry stress. This is expressed by the following rule:\n(3) Compound Stress Rule\n#  1  #  #  1  # \u2192 #  1  #  3  #                          = when compounding two words, downgrade the\n                                                          primary  stress  of  the  second  word  to  strong\u2011\n                                                          unstressed (3ry) level.\nExamples for initially\u2011stressed compounds, with the stressed element underlined:\n NOUNS: gr\u00e9enhouse, c\u00e1r ferry, scr\u00e9ensaver, c\u00e1n\u2011opener, a b\u00fayout, a wr\u00edte\u2011off, sh\u00f3plifting,\n       C\u00e1non Street, p\u00e1perback, p\u00e1perback writer, l\u00e1nguage teaching,  nempl\u00f3yment benefit\n ADJECTIVES: w\u00e1terproof, f\u00fan\u2011loving, ch\u00f3colate coloured, s\u00fanlit\n2 In Hungarian invisible compounds are less frequent, e.g. t\u00far\u00f3s csusza, m\u00e9rges k\u00edgy\u00f3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3054, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91bbd1f-b673-4865-8803-4021cc27a9d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91bbd1f-b673-4865-8803-4021cc27a9d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d575fe65-8821-423d-ab24-0ec19092d707", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a98e2ddd4c53e3751f2fe58143b6219f8abf898cc891759495798406cd713b15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                                   5\n\n VERBS: to b\u00e1by\u2011sit, to h\u00e9adhunt, to b\u00e9lly\u2011dance, to \u00e1ir\u2011condition, to wh\u00edtewash\nObscured compounds.

THE TONE-UNIT\n\nA tone\u2011unit is a stretch of speech whose last stress is a tonic (the stressed syllable on which\nthe voice begins to fall or rise). The tone\u2011unit usually corresponds to a sentence. If a sentence\nis  longer,  the  speaker  usually  breaks  it  up  into  several  tone\u2011units.

The only thing shown is the space between words.\n       Content-words  are  the  four  major  word  classes:  nouns,  verbs,  adjectives,  and  adverbs\n(including  adverbial  particles  like  up  in  get  up).  Numerals  (e.g.  two),  interrogative  and  de\u2011\nmonstrative  pronouns  (e.g.  who?,  this),  and  negative  words  (e.g.  not, couldn\u2019t)  are  stressed\nlike  content\u2011words.  Function-words  are  all  others:  auxiliaries,  most  pronouns,  articles,  and\nconjunctions. Note that prepositions (e.g. with, along) also behave like function\u2011words.7\n\nThe tonic\nWe have seen the working of the End\u2011Weight Principle: if a longer word has several stresses,\nthe last one is the strongest (the primary, as in j stific\u00e1tion). Similarly, in an English sentence\nthe last stressed word has the strongest stress, called the tonic. The tonic is, properly speak\u2011\ning,  a  syllable  (since  stress  is  always  attached  to  a  syllable),  but  we  will  often  refer  to  the\ntonic\u2011bearing  word as \u201cthe tonic  word\u201d  or simply \u201cthe tonic\u201d.8  For  example,  in  We  met  in\nOctober, the tonic is really the syllable -to-, but we may also express this by saying that Octo-\nber is the tonic: We met in October.\n       In transcription it is not necessary to show the tonic specially, since it is by definition the\nlast stress. If necessary, the tonic can be highlighted by underlining the syllable (or the word\nthat contains it), and by placing an arrow in front of the tonic syllable (  or  , depending on\nwhether the voice falls or rises there).\n\n                                                   7.5. RHYTHM\n7.5.1. The Rhythmic Foot\n\u2014  The way stressed syllables follow each other in the \u201chead\u201d of the tone\u2011unit  is  called\nrhythm. The unit of English rhythm is the rhythmic foot.9 A foot is a stressed syllable plus\nthe unstressed syllables that follow it. Each tone unit is made up of one or more such feet. The\nfirst foot may be incomplete, consisting of unstressed syllables only: this is pre\u2011head. The last\nfoot always begins with the tonic: this is the tonic foot (consisting of tonic + tail).\n       The following sentence is a tone\u2011unit consisting of five feet. (Foot boundaries are shown\nhere with a vertical line. The missing stress in the pre\u2011head is shown by ^.)\n       | ^ We de|\u2032cided to |\u2032come |\u2032back in Oc| to ber. |\nRhythmic feet need not coincide with words or grammatical structures. There exist feet like\n\u201ccided to\u201d  or  \u201cback in Oc\u201c.\n7 Content\u2011words are also called \u201clexical words\u201d. Function\u2011words are also called \u201cgrammatical words\u201d\n   or \u201cform\u2011words\u201d. Some authors in syntax consider prepositions  to  be  content  words  rather  than\n   function words.\n8 The tonic is also called nucleus, or sentence\u2011stress, or accent.\n9 The notion of \u201cfoot\u201d is borrowed from poetry.

The Rhythm Rule: stress-deletion\nWhen three stresses come too closely together, English tends to delete the middle one to make\nthe rhythm smoother. This is called the Rhythm Rule. The deletion means that the syllable is\ndowngraded  from  2ry  to  3ry  stress.  There  are  two  subcases:  in  one  case  the  deleted  middle\nstress is a short word  (nice old lady); in the other it is the second stress of a word having a\n2ry+1ry lexical stress (afternoon tea).\n7.5.2.1. Rhythmic stress deletion (\u201cnice old lady\u201d rule)\nWhen three stresses come closely together, with  maximally one unstressed syllable between\nthem (\u02c8nice \u02c8old \u02c8lady), the middle one of the three stresses may optionally be deleted (\u201cde\u2011\nstressed\u201d) to make the rhythm smoother: \u02c8nice old \u02c8lady. Such de\u2011stressing does not depend\non the meaning or grammatical role of the word affected, just the rhythmic pattern\n      In the examples below all stresses are underlined. The deleted middle stress (downgraded\nto 3ry) is shown with a small circle (o).\n          three stresses close together                    Medial Stress-Deletion\n                a \u2032nice \u2032old \u2032lady               \u2192              a \u2032nice  oold \u2032lady\n                  \u2032very \u2032nice \u2032people            \u2192                \u2032very  onice \u2032people\n            my \u2032son \u2032speaks \u2032Hindi               \u2192          my \u2032son  speaks \u2032Hindi o\n                 \u2032John 1disa\u2032ppeared             \u2192               \u2032John  odisa\u2032ppeared\nThe  deletion  also  happens  in  the  middle  of  very  long  words  which  have  two  secondary\nstresses before the primary:\n                    \u02ccpsycho\u02ccana\u2032lytical                    \u2192         1psycho oana\u2032lytical\n                    \u02ccunde\u02ccnomi\u2032national                    \u2192         1unde onomi\u2032national\nIn We de\u2032cided to \u2032come \u2032back in Oc\u2032tober, stress deletion is not normal because though there\nare two stresses (come, back) next to each other; there isn\u2019t a third stress close enough.\n      Medial  Stress\u2011Deletion  causes  short  content  words  to  lose  their  stress,  or  a  secondary\nstress to be lost in the middle of a longer word (or finally\u2011stressed compound). The result is\nthe deletion of a foot, as the de\u2011stressed word now becomes attached to the previous foot.

Stress-shift (\u201cafternoon tea\u201d rule)\nIf a word with two stresses (e.g. 1after\u2032noon) is immediately followed by a stressed word, three\nstresses fall closely together: 1after\u2032noon \u2032tea.

For  example, 1North \u2032Sea,  when  followed  by  \u00f3il,  loses  the  stress  on\nSea and appears with shifted stress as \u2032North Sea.\n      1North \u2032Sea  \u2192 \u2032North  oSea \u2032oil                                 1New \u2032Year  \u2192 \u2032New  oYear\u2019s \u2032Eve\n      1duty \u2032free  \u2192 \u2032duty  ofree \u2032goods                               1World \u2032War  \u2192 \u2032World  oWar \u2032Two\n\nThe two applications of the Rhythm Rule, Medial Stress\u2011Deletion and Stress\u2011Shift, are basi\u2011\ncally the same: they eliminate a stress between two other stresses. They have no communica\u2011\ntive  significance:  they  are  not  applied  to  emphasize  any  part  of  the  message.  They  are  me\u2011\nchanical means to ensure a smoother rhythm in speech.

TONIC PLACEMENT\n\nThis section  will  examine  the rule s for  tonic  place ment, that  is,  choosing  the  word  that  re\u2011\nceives the stronge st (=  last major) stress in a  tone unit.11 The place of the tonic ca n be neu-\ntral12 (i.e. unmarked), or dislocated (i.e. marked, typically contrastive). The neutral tonic has\nno spec ial  communicative  value,  and is prescribe d by  general rule s. The  disloca ted tonic  is\nplaced by the speaker on some other word  than where it  would normally fall, in order  to ex\u2011\npress some communicative surplus by highlighting some element.\n10 Words undergoing Stress\u2011Shift (afternoon, North Sea) are also called \u201clevel\u2011stressed\u201d, because their\n  stressing can \u201ctilt\u201d either way.\n11 Tonic placement is also called \u201ctonicity\u201d. All sentences in 7.6.1 have neutral tonicity.\n12 This use of the term \u201eneutral\u201d has nothing to do with \u201cneutralization\u201d!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3024, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ae2d71-efc4-4498-b0bb-edc812bf6f84": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ae2d71-efc4-4498-b0bb-edc812bf6f84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eef12fd1-0a85-4e1d-8758-41984fd0906c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43f376989c3faf48249153217f887c36e146fce14e34f6367e2b4eb2323f342f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                                    11\n\n7.6.1. Neutral Tonic\n\n7.6.1.1. On the last content word\nThe  neutral  tonic  falls  on  the  last  content\u2011word  of  the  tone\u2011unit.  This  is  the  Last  Content-\nWord  Rule.  If  the  last  words  are  function\u2011words,  they  remain  unstressed  because  these  are\nnot \u201ctonic\u2011bearing\u201d.  The  neutral  tonic  is  mechanically  assigned:  the  tonic  need  not  be  the\nmost \u201cimportant\u201d or communicatively most informative word. For example:\n       \u2032Pat\u2019s \u2032father is an ex\u2032tremely \u2032rich  man.

They \u2032couldn\u2019t  wait for us.\n7.6.1.2. On a function-word\nThe  neutral  tonic  may,  in  well\u2011defined  cases,  fall  on  some  function  word.  We  will  discuss\nonly two of these cases: neutral tonic on an auxiliary, and on an adverbial particle.\n Neutral tonic and auxiliaries. An auxiliary (including the finite forms of be, do, have) has\nthe tonic if there is no further stressable word in the sentence: \u2032Yes, we  may.  \u2013  \u2032Jim \u2032always\n does. \u2013 This includes  questions where the auxiliary is followed by its  unstressed personal\npronoun subject: \u2032How ex\u2032pensive  is it?  \u2013  \u2032Where  am I?  \u2013  \u2032How  are you?\nHowever,  when  a  sentence\u2011final  auxiliary  is  preceded  by  its  own  stressed  subject,  the  tonic\nfalls on the subject and the auxiliary is unstressed (but strong, i.e. tertiary\u2011stressed!):\n           You \u2032play \u2032better than  Joe does.                           I \u2032wonder \u2032when the e xam will be.\n           \u2032That\u2019s the \u2032pub where my  friends are.                     It \u2032fits me \u2032better than  yours would.\nA final auxiliary is never reduced to zero stress.\nNeutral tonic and adverbial particles. An adverbial particle13 forms part of a phrasal verb:\nget up, put off. The particle has no weak form, and is usually stressed:\n       You should \u2032get \u2032up before  six. \u2013 I \u2032couldn\u2019t \u2032ring you \u2032back on  Tuesday.\n  Sentence\u2011finally  (possibly  followed  by  non\u2011stressable  words),  it  can  have  two  kinds  of\nstressing:\n(a) It is tonic\u2011bearing after a verb or after an unstressed pronoun:\n       \u2032Get  up!                         \u2032Please \u2032put that  down.

A  phrasal  verb  is  thus  stressed  either  on  both  components  (\u2032geto\n\u2032up), or on the particle only (get \u2032up).\n      Let us remark that prepositions  behave differently  from adverbial particles in syntax as\nwell as in prosody. Laugh  at, deal with, sit on are  Prepositional verbs14 (verbs requiring  a\nprepositional complement), while call off, break up, put on are Phrasal Verbs (Verb + Ad\u2011\nverbial  Particle).  There  is  a  syntactic  differene:  I  [put  on]  the  hat  \u2013  I  sat  [on  the  hat].  A\npreposition  normally appears in  a reduced (\u201cweak\u201d) form, while adverbial particles have no\nweak form. The words at, for, from, of, to, with, without are only used as prepositions, never\nas adverbial particles, while other words (up, off, etc.) can function as either.\n      A phrasal verb may be followed by a preposition, e.g. hang on to (\u2018insist\u2019), get away with\n(\u2018escape\u2019), go in for (\u2018enjoy\u2019). The stress of such combinations follows the rules outlined so\nfar: the adverbial particle is stressed, the preposition unstressed. Examples:\n      \u2032Don\u2019t hang \u2032on to this \u2032stupid i dea.                         \u2032Don\u2019t hang  on to it.\n      \u2032What is he \u2032hanging  on to?                                   \u2032Don\u2019t hang \u2032on to  THAT!\n7.6.2. Dislocated Tonic Placement\nIn order to focus some part of the message, to contrast it with something, or to highlight it as\nnew  information,  the  tonic  may  be  dislocated,  i.e.  placed  elsewhere  than  the  neutral\u2011\nplacement rules would prescribe. Compare:\n          (a) She spent a year in the  forest.                       \u2013 neutral tonic placement\n          (b) She spent a  YEAR in the forest.                       \u2013 dislocated tonic placement\nA dislocated tonic need not be louder than the other stresses \u2013 it is just earlier or later than it\nwould  be  in  the  neutral  stress  pattern.  (In  the  following  examples  the  dislocated  tonic  is\nprinted in CAPITALS.)\n      In everyday life people use the word \u201cstress\u201d exactly for this kind of emphasis, and not\nfor the syllabic prominence that \u201cstress\u201d means to the linguist. People say: The  headmaster\nstressed that our school was a traditional one, meaning that he laid special emphasis on tradi\u2011\ntion. (The same is done in Hungarian, where the everyday meaning of \u201changs\u00faly(oz)\u201d is simi\u2011\nlarly \u201cemphasis, emphasize\u201d: z igazgat\u00f3 hangs\u00falyozta...). The layman would say that in sen\u2011\ntence (a) above we \u201cdidn\u2019t stress anything\u201d, while in (b) we \u201cstressed\u201d that it was  a  whole\nyear. From a linguistic point of view, the word year is stressed in both (a) and (b); but in (b) it\nis made emphatic by receiving a dislocated tonic.\n7.6.2.1. Dislocated tonic for contrast\nThe tonic may be dislocated in order to contrast one element (a word, a morpheme, or a gram\u2011\nmatical feature, like tense).\n (A) LEXICAL CONTRAST\n14 Hung. \u2018el\u00f6lj\u00e1r\u00f3s v. vonzatos ige\u2019.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3103, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "898ac9b7-27c7-4f18-990c-4a37a45ac6bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "898ac9b7-27c7-4f18-990c-4a37a45ac6bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da025f05-d24f-4a45-8f37-32c7bfbcc92b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ce386deafcc066c660095634b73c004a68255b08515bc6acca3d2eb9c42da2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                               13\n\nA frequent case of dislocated tonic placement is  lexical contrast, when  the speaker empha\u2011\nsizes a word which is earlier than the tonic. For example\n          Jane  BOUGHT three rabbits at the market.  (She did not sell them.)\n          Tim was so drunk he literally  CRAWLED out of the pub.  (instead of walking)\nEven the verb be can be lexically contrasted:\n          (She sounds Welsh to me.) \u2014 \u2032That\u2019s be\u02c8cause she  IS Welsh.\n          (It tasted like bad wine.)  \u2014  It  WAS bad wine.\n (B) VERBAL CONTRASTS: MODALITY AND YES/NO POLARITY\nAnother type of contrast that we express with a dislocated tonic concerns the mood, tense, or\npositive/negative value (the \u201cpolarity\u201d) of the verb. The two sentences below show these three\ntypes of difference:\n      (a) Tim will enjoy the per formance.  (neutral tonic)\n                   (indicative mood, future tense, positive polarity)\n      (b) Tim  WON\u2019T enjoy the performance.\n                   (indicative mood, future tense, negative polarity)\nThis is not lexical contrast since the verb  (enjoy) is the same: the speaker is not contrasting\none verb with another, but is contrasting the accompanying values of the same verb. In mo\u2011\ndality  and  polarity  contrast,  the  dislocated  tonic  always  falls  on  an  auxiliary.  If  there  is  no\nauxiliary (in the simple present or past), the auxiliary do has to come in to bear the tonic.\n (i) Verbal modality (mood and tense) contrast\n\u201cMood\u201d, for our purposes, includes not only indicative and conditional, but also meanings\nexpressed by the modal auxiliaries (can, could, ought to, etc.). The category \u201ctense\u201d covers all\nverbal categories including aspect like continuous (= progressive), passive, etc.\n      (Has Sue gone to France?) \u2014 No, but she  MIGHT go.\n      (When will the students write the application?) \u2014 They  ARE writing it.\n      (Why don\u2019t you try the cheesecake?) \u2014 I  HAVE tried it, thanks.\n      (I think Tim works at a hospital.)  \u2014  He  DID work there (...but doesn\u2019t any more).\n      (You should use this dictionary.)  \u2014  We  DO use it.\n      (Shouldn\u2019t Joe study classical music?) \u2014 He  DOES study classical music.\n (ii) Yes/No polarity (positive/negative) contrast\nThe  other  type  of  non\u2011lexical  contrast  in  verbs  concerns  \u201cpolarity\u201d,  namely,  positive  (=  af\u2011\nfirmative) versus negative meaning. Polarity contrast (answering \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cno\u201d, or vice versa)\nis again achieved by placing the tonic on the auxiliary:\n      (Sue can learn it on her own.) \u2014 She  CAN\u2019T learn it on her own.\n      (You can\u2019t come in because you\u2019re not members.) \u2014 We  ARE members.\n      (I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve bought the tickets.) \u2014 We  HAVEN\u2019T bought them.\n      (You don\u2019t like fish and chips, I suppose.) \u2014 I  DO like fish and chips.\n      (It\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t write to Liz.) \u2014 I  DID write to her.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2927, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19f3b230-ed1f-4919-92f7-39f33d4aed0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "19f3b230-ed1f-4919-92f7-39f33d4aed0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04cfcf4a-52e4-47f1-9b29-dba9bd1eca16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2cc201a086ff67477e3bbf0399124c10a7b2e04538097fd7df4318be6371cf4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                            14\n\n\nRemember  that  do-  forms  or  other  auxiliaries  are  not  needed  in  cases  of  lexical  contrast,\nwhere the verb itself must be stressed:\n          (Was Tim ill in hospital for so long?) \u2014 No, he  WORKED there.\n          (Why don\u2019t you throw away this old dictionary?) \u2014 We  USE it!\n          (Joe teaches classical music, doesn\u2019t he?) \u2014 He  STUDIES classical music.\n7.6.2.2. Dislocated tonic for highlighting new information\nThe speaker may consider some part of his sentence as \u201cold\u201d information, known both to him\nand the listener. If this old information is at the end of the sentence, the speaker will de\u2011stress\nthe words which express it, and move the tonic leftwards to the (end of the) \u201cnew\u201d informa\u2011\ntion.  In  such  cases  there  is  no  contrast  or  emphasis  involved;  the  tonic\u2011bearing  word  is  not\nopposed to anything, it is just highlighted as new.\n      In  the  examples  below  the  old  information  is  printed  in  italics;  the  DISLOCATED\nTONIC which highlights the (last stress of the) new information, is capitalized:\n      (Was the headmaster angry about it?) \u2014 I \u2032didn\u2019t  SPEAK to the headmaster.\n      (We only serve Indian food here.) \u2014 I  WANT Indian.\n      (My wife comes from Singapore.) \u2014 Oh, I \u2032grew  UP in Singapore!\nSometimes the fact that the information is \u201cold\u201d (= \u201cgiven\u201d) is only obvious from the situation\nor from the hearer\u2019s knowledge of the general background:\n          \u2032Here\u2019s the C D I promised to bring you.\n          (Leeds is a very busy town.) \u2014 I know, my  PARENTS live there.\nAnaphoric words de-stressed for old information\nThe  speaker  may,  alternatively,  choose  to  express  the  old  information  with  unstressed  con\u2011\ntent\u2011words, usually synonyms or other words which refer to the things mentioned:\n      (Why\u2019s that man looking at you?) \u2014 I \u2032went to  SCHOOL with the guy.\n      (Everyone was talking Chinese to me,) but I \u2032don\u2019t  SPEAK the language.\n      (Joe ran away) be\u2032fore I could  ASK the idiot.\nIn all these cases the tonic counts as dislocated because it is not on the last content word.\n                                            7.7. INTONATION\n\nIn the preceding sections we discussed one component of prosody: stress. We now turn to the\nother prosodic component: intonation. While stress concerns the loudness of syllables, intona\u2011\ntion  concerns  their  height, called \u201cpitch\u201d in linguistics.15  People  easily  confuse  a  high  pitch\nwith a loud stress: these often appear together, but are not the same (see the examples in 7.1).\nIntonation includes two things only: the melodies or \u201ctones\u201d (with their meanings and func\u2011\n15 Hung. \u2018hangmagass\u00e1g\u2019.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2752, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2add4b75-a7eb-45ba-ab45-9ff72c286d96": {"__data__": {"id_": "2add4b75-a7eb-45ba-ab45-9ff72c286d96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3ebf974f-d351-4721-bf41-b3bc2483796d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "41200351eace38e98b6101272e35cfa271396956b23a9dd1286862554ccf4b59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "English Phonological Analysis \u2013 Chapter 7 \u2013 PROSODY (Autumn 2013)                                          15\n\ntions), and the division  of speech into tone\u2011units (that is,  where one intonation pattern ends\nand the next one begins).16\n      The pitch of the speaker\u2019s voice is influenced by several factors. (a) natural factors  (=\n\u201csymptoms\u201d) like sex and age: women and children have a higher pitch than men, and every\nperson  has  a  characteristic  pitch;  (b)  paralinguistic  factors:  an  excited  speaker  will  use  a\nhigher pitch than someone who is tired or bored; (c) linguistic factors: the pitch may depend\non whether the utterance is a question or a command, old or new information, encouraging or\nneutral. These linguistic factors belong to the field of intonation.\n      Besides pitch, speech has other features like loudness and tempo, and is accompanied by\ngestures and facial expressions (sometimes called \u201cbody language\u201d), all of which are impor\u2011\ntant for communication, but do not form part of the linguistic system.\n7.7.1. The components of intonation\nIn speech the height of a given syllable is called pitch. In phonology the linguistically rele\u2011\nvant (= \u201cphonemic\u201d) pitch  changes  are  examined:  this  is  what  we  call  intonation.  In  every\ntone\u2011unit, the last stress, the tonic, is accompanied by pitch change, i.e. the voice falls or rises\non that syllable. The pitch\u2011change attached to a tonic syllable is a tone.\nThe English tones\nEnglish has four phonologically distinct tones. One is falling, three are rising.\n        Type         Name of           Diagram         Example                         Meaning\n                        tone\n      Falling  Fall                                     Blue          neutrality, definiteness, finality\n                  Fall-rise                            \\ Blue         implication; softening; old info\n      Rising      Low rise                              Blue          indifference; encouragement\n                  High rise                             Blue          inquiry; Yes/No question\nIntonation can be represented with lines actually depicting the rising or falling of the voice.\nThe tone (= the pitch change on the tonic syllable) is shown with a thick line.\nExample 1.

The \\ first part is interesting.\nFunction\nThe fall\u2011rise has the following functions/meanings:\n(a) Implications. What we say is not the whole truth. The speaker has reservations, does not\nagree completely, or is hesitant to plainly say his opinion: \u201cyes, but...\u201d We call it implicational\nbecause it implies something that remains unsaid (this is added after three dots in the exam\u2011\nples below).\n      (Shall we go by car?) \u2014 \\ Fine.  (...but I won\u2019t drive)\n      We \u2032like to \\ travel.  (...but not to silly places like that)\nSuch sentences often have a dislocated tonic:\n      The \\ FIRST part is interesting. (...but the rest isn\u2019t)\nThe implication conveyed by the fall\u2011rise is often that something should be done:\n      \\ Dinner\u2019s ready! (...so come and sit down)\n      I \u2032can\u2019t \\ lift this.  (...so please help me)\n(b)  Partial  negation.  The  fall\u2011rise  is  able  to  express  partial  negation  (see  the  (b)  sentences\nbelow), implying that the thing is true on the whole, but some part of it is negated. While or\u2011\ndinary full negation (a), expressed by the fall, simply means \u201cno\u201d, the partial negation ex\u2011\npressed by the fall\u2011rise means \u201cyes, but...\u201d. Compare:\n    (a)  I \u2032won\u2019t \u2032eat  anything.  (full negation; \u2018I will eat nothing\u2019)\n    (b)  I \u2032won\u2019t \u2032eat \\ anything.  (partial negation; \u2018I\u2019ll eat, but not everything\u2019)\n    (a)  We \u2032haven\u2019t \u2032heard them  once.  (full negation; \u2018never heard them\u2019)\n    (b)  We \u2032haven\u2019t \u2032heard them \\ once. (partial negation; \u2018heard them many times\u2019)\n    (a)  It \u2032wasn\u2019t \u2032published because a  woman wrote it.\n          (full negation; \u2018it wasn\u2019t published, and the reason was that a woman wrote it\u2019)\n    (b)  It \u2032wasn\u2019t \u2032published because a \\ woman wrote it.\n          (partial negation; \u2018it was published, though not for this reason\u2019)\n(c)  Softening.

Structure versus history\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nKnowledge of the structure of a language is quite different from knowing its history, knowing where it\ncame from (more specifically, what the origins are of its phonological system, phonotactic rules, syntax,\nsemantics, you name it). Structure and history (or origin, if you like) can be studied independently, and\nrightly  so  because  different  points  of  view  can  shed  light  on  an  entity  from  quite  different  (and\nsurprising) angles. This means no entity will ever have just the one interpretation. (If this were possible,\nthis  one  interpretation  would  necessarily  have  to  be  the  only  right  one.)  This  course  has  hopefully\nmanged to dispel this idea: no interpretation is ever the only possible (and right) one. So, rest assured\nneither the  structural  nor the  historical aspect is better than the  other.  They  are  complementary,  one\ntrying to describe what the other can\u2019t or won\u2019t access.\n\n           Up  to  now,  very  little  has  been  said  about  the  history  of  phonemes,  sounds,  intonational\ncontours, etc. (or about whether such historical accounts are possible at all given the time factor and the\nfact that the footprints of a language used to be largely confined to the written, rather than the spoken,\nmedium and as such offer no insight into what something may have sounded like). What\u2019s more, this\nproblem is compounded by the fact that what comes down to us from the past was usually recorded\n(composed) by rich literate men (or clergymen who were again men), rather than (rich) literate women\nor illiterate poor (wo)men.\n\n           It seems a natural necessity of all existing things to change, not for better or for worse, change\nhappens for no obvious (or no psychologically, humanly understandable) reason. It simply seems that\nchanges are part of a complex web that is still too complex for us to comprehend. This doesn\u2019t mean\nthat one shouldn\u2019t approach change, it only means that no judgements should be passed on any one stage\n(of any structure of any language) being better or surpassing any other stage (of any language). This is\nwhy sciences are impartial, seemingly cold and aloof, but objective, non\u2011judgemental and non\u2011personal\n(pretty much like a Buddhist\u2019s view on the order of things). Think of biology or physics, for example:\nphysics will never claim that a supernova is at a more advanced level than a red giant, nor will biology\npass  any  judgements  on  the  anatomy  of  a  cockroach  (as  opposed  to  a  swan,  a  willow  warbler  or  a\ndolphin). Such statements would simply be laughable. The same principle holds in linguistics: we will\nobserve, compare, analyse, establish orders of precedence of rules, but will never have anything to say\nabout why something is better or worse than anything else we observe, because such statements are\nnonsensical in sciences.\n\n1.2 What can history teach us?\n\n                                                     ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34, "end_char_idx": 3087, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91905ab2-ab8b-4693-a393-a9c282e67e89": {"__data__": {"id_": "91905ab2-ab8b-4693-a393-a9c282e67e89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a207ccd2-9e69-4610-b2e5-04cf68d49560", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8afbf9c9b720f7359223ee2bf7083915b1ccd90237f8892f51c46faeca961596", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As it turns out, everything is part of a larger structure, and as such has a history as well. You may have\nwondered why the human respiratory system is as imperfect as it is (note that this is not a scientific\nstatement,  but  a  human  sentiment).  Our  lungs  are  only  capable  of  performing  a  bi\u2011tidal  respiratory\nfunction. This means that we can at any one time either inhale or exhale, but not both, and the lungs can\nnever be totally emptied of the inhaled air. This is similar to the movement of the seas: we either have\nan outgoing tide or an incoming tide but not both. Birds, in contrast, have a different take on the problem:\ntheir bodies have a system of interconnected airsacks in addition to lungs, which ensures that air can\nboth exit and enter their bodies at the same time through different channels (their nostrils and mouths).\nThis anatomical trait ensures that they have all the energy required for prolonged flying, which is both\nenergy\u2011 and oxygen\u2011consuming.\n\n           But why are our lungs as they are? From a structural anatomical point of view little can be said\nabout this, apart from describing this and drawing conclusions from this for the whole of the system (we\nmay now understand why humans get tired very easily performing physically demanding exercises: the\nblood simply can\u2019t draw enough oxygen from the lungs, which as we see now can  only  work\nunidirectionally, first inhaling then exhaling thus losing precious time in drawing further supplies of\nair). But this is where a structural analysis stops.\n\n           But what can we say about this anatomical \u2018flaw\u2019 from a historical point of view? If we examine\nfish we will see that fish have an air bladder that can be filled with oxygen from the blood, but this air\nbladder is part of the fish\u2019s digestive system. Human lungs, evolutionary biologists think, developed out\nof this air bladder of a distant ancestor, a bud on our digestive system. So, historically our lungs are\nclosely associated with our stomachs, which explains why the air can only be inhaled and exhaled in\none direction (air is basically food and food is normally only transported in one direction, away from\nthe  mouth  into  the  stomach).  As  you  can  see,  exhaling  air  can  now  be  viewed  as  an  evolutionary\ninnovation (inhalation, just like passing food down our gullets, is older historically/evolutionary).\n\n           You  may  wonder  which  aspect  of  our  analysis is  more  worth  pursuing:  the  historical  or  the\nstructural? There is no answer to this, both enrich in their own ways our understanding of our respiratory\nsystem.  Which one  you  chose  or  prefer is  down  to  you  (this  is  a  personal  choice,  not  one  based  on\nscientific evaluation and as such cannot be discussed objectively).\n\n1.3 Do languages have a structural and a historical aspect to their analysis?\n\nThe  answer  has  to  be  in  the  affirmative.  Analysing  a  language  can  happen  at  two  independent,  but\ncomplementary levels. One deals with structure: the system of contrastive building blocks (features like\nvoice,  nasality,  place  of  articulation,  manner  of  articulation),  phonemes,  contrasts,  syllables  (and\nwhether they exist), stress (and whether any generalisations can be drawn on them based on the various\npatterns we encounter), intonation (and whether the various contours can be used contrastively and how\nthis can be described). This approach you have been engrossed in up to now is synchronic linguistics\n\n                                                      ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3596, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9847f1fa-d88d-4ebe-b174-a4bfb4f0e04d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9847f1fa-d88d-4ebe-b174-a4bfb4f0e04d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9fd0f606-c0b9-45c7-967b-61d933a6fc76", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02f014cce4a58c07354009d8a0aa6441277de97977cff77d3a529d8f208d9588", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(ancient Greek syn- \u2018together, next to\u2019 and chron- \u2018time\u2019, referring to units of analysis present at the\nsame level of reference/slice of time, say 19th century English, or contemporary South African English),\non a par with anatomy (no questions asked about where our lungs come from, only their function can be\ninspected and how they fit into the larger unit that we call the organism). This approach may have its\nlimitations, but then the synchronic approach can never be aware of its own shortcomings because it\ndoesn\u2019t have the means to assess its own limitations. You are now aware why we say that \u025bj (as in pane)\nand \u025b\u02d0 (as in pair) are two phonemes of this language, but you don\u2019t know anything about whether this\nhas always been the case or not. This is not a problem, you may not want to consider this a problem, or\nyou  may  have  other  reasons  to  dismiss  history,  the  fact  remains  that  all  analysts  doing  synchronic\nlinguistics have to live with absence of history in a synchronic analysis.\n\n           The complementary approach is called diachronic linguistics (Greek dia- \u2018across\u2019 and chron-\n\u2018time\u2019), referring to a point of view when items are inspected as they developed from each other, not as\nthey coexisted with other units of analysis at the respective point of reference/slice of time. Historical\nlinguistics will tell you after some deliberation that (some instances of) \u025b\u02d0 derive from \u025bj, so \u025b\u02d0 is an\ninnovation. If you dig deeper you will realise that even \u025bj is an innovation, deriving from e\u02d0. Dig deeper\nstill and you will see that (some instances of) e\u02d0 derive from a\u02d0 (pane having originally been pa\u02d0n). And\nwho knows what further  linguistic excavations will produce. Similar chains of developments can be\nestablished  for  the  rest  of  the  phonemes  of  the  language.

Let us see some of these approaches.\n\n           Typological linguistics usually analyses syntactic and morphological similarities. For example,\nit looks at whether languages have prepositions (like English, French, Croatian: e.g., in the school, sur\nla  maison  \u2018on the house\u2019,  u  kutiji  \u2018in the box\u2019)  or  postpositions  (like  Hungarian:  iskol\u00e1ban,  h\u00e1zon,\ndobozban). It may also look at how morphological material is organised with respect to the base of the\nword: some  languages  have  long complex  words  built  up  of  a  sequence  of  affixes  centred  around  a\nsyntactically independent semantic core and are thus word-based, like Hungarian, Finnish or Turkish:\ne.g., HU megm\u00e9rettet\u00e9seidben \u2018in your (singular) allowing yourself to be tested for what you can do\n(plural)\u2019 with the ultimate stem m\u00e9r \u2018measure, test\u2019, which is also an independently occurring word.1\nSome languages are stem-based (affixes are added to a syntactically non\u2011independent core, as it is done\nin Latin, Greek or the Slavonic languages. For example, the stem behind the word for earth in Latin\nterra is terr-, something which can never be found on its own/in isolation (that\u2019s why you will find a\nhyphen after such data): terr\u2011 is thus abstracted away from terra, terrae, terr\u0101, terram, terrarium, terras\nand the rest of the shapes that this stem can take on. Hungarian and Latin thus belong to two different\ntypes of languages as far as morpheme independence is concerned. Both Hungarian and Latin, however,\nare referred to as synthetic languages (they synthesise a number of morphemes into long words). They\ncontrast sharply with Chinese, which is an analytic language where there is little or no inflection (so\nthere are no complex/synthetically inflected words). No language is perfect from any perspective, of\ncourse: Hungarian has bound stems (in j\u00e1t\u00e9k \u2018toy\u2019 and j\u00e1tszik \u2018to play\u2019 there is a bound stem j\u00e1t\u2011), and\nChinese has compound words (and thus its derivational morphology is not analytic). English is more\nanalytic than Hungarian, but its inflection still shows signs of synthesising (boys boy+Plural is still a\nsynthetically  formed  word,  just  like  begs  beg+3  person+singular+present+indicative).  The\nderivational morphology of English can still be argued to be heavily synthetic.\n\n           It may also analyse how passivisation is executed: morphologically, syntactically or lexically.\nOf course, no language will ever be a perfect example of just one type of process. Languages will always\nbe scattered on a cline of features. Hungarian, for example, can express the logico\u2011semantic concept of\npossibility  by  either  using  a  suffix  (e.g.  tanul-hat  \u2018can study\u2019,  literally  study-can)  or  a  syntactically\nindependent word/auxiliary (tud tanulni or b\u00edr tanulni), similarly to English (can study), although the\n1 The affixes are as follows: meg- \u2018perfective\u2019, -et \u2018let it happen to oneself\u2019, -tet \u2018causative\u2019, -\u00e9s \u2018nominalising suffix\u2019, -e \u20183\nperson singular possessive\u2019, -i \u2018plural possessive\u2019, -d \u20182 person possessive\u2019, -ben \u2018suffix meaning in\u2019\n\n                                                      ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3651, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65adfd28-15ec-4171-8478-8caffdd81378": {"__data__": {"id_": "65adfd28-15ec-4171-8478-8caffdd81378", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1610dc4d-4fd0-4b2e-8b29-905249920ec2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "534c99be853de04d962530767a0d997d311537d4426d01c3c481344fb48e5957", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "two languages are generally taken to belong to two different morphological types of languages. Note\nthat in a typological analysis any language can be compared with any other.\n\n           As  is  well\u2011known,  languages may  develop  similar  features  because  they are  spoken in close\nproximity to each other and speakers have a chance of mixing through marriage, trade, shared pastures,\netc. Areal linguistics looks at how features may spread from one to language to the other. It is generally\nclaimed that Hungarian has developed a complex system of verbal prefixation through extended contact\nwith languages such as German and Russian (e.g., csin\u00e1lni \u2018to do\u2019 vs meg-csin\u00e1lni \u2018to have done it\u2019, ki-\ncsin\u00e1lni \u2018to have aggravated somebody\u2019, be-csin\u00e1lni \u2018to have been scared stiff\u2019, fel-csin\u00e1lni \u2018to have put\nher up the duff\u2019, etc.). We are not saying here that the verbal prefixes meg\u2011 or le\u2011 are of German or\nRussian origin, of course. The lexical material is Hungarian, the principle is non\u2011Hungarian originally\n(= express perfectivity with prefixes, not with auxiliaries or different tenses). Some claim that bilingual\nspeakers are the key in understanding these similarities because it\u2019s only through such speakers that\naspects of any language can be internalised in another. This aspect of language contact can be observed\nat any level (phonology, morphology, syntax, and probably most visibly in the lexicon, etc.).\n\n           Hungarian may have developed the use of prefixes to cover an area for what it originally used\ndifferent tenses, but it doesn\u2019t mean that its use of prefixes (or their distribution) will be identical to that\nin German or the Slavonic languages. In Hungarian prefixes are usually very mobile (they can appear\nseparated from the verb to which they attach: meg fogja \u0151 ezt m\u00e9g biztos csin\u00e1lni \u2018he will still do this\nsurely\u2019 where meg- has been separated from its verbal host csin\u00e1l over a long stretch of words). This\nmobility  is  unheard  of  in  Croatian  and  Serbian,  for  example,  some  of  those  languages  from  where\nperfective prefixation may have spread into Hungarian: Uraditi \u0107e on to jo\u0161 sigurno \u2018he will still do this\nsurely\u2019 where the prefix u\u2011 always stays glued to its verbal host raditi \u2018do\u2019 irrespectively of the syntactic\nenvironment.\n\n           For a casual observer, words as they appear at first sight are the most easily graspable points of\nsimilarities  (and  differences)  between  languages.  For this to happen you don\u2019t even need bilingual\nspeakers. Observe the short sentence below taken from the dialect of Hungarian spoken in Vojvodina\n(Vajdas\u00e1g) in Serbia.\n\n(2) Hungarian of Vojvodina\nA  feles\u00e9gem  a  m\u00e1sodik  szmen\u00e1ba  dolgozik,  \u00e9s zsurb\u00e1ba volt, amikor l\u00e1ttam lej\u00f6nni a szolit\u00e9rb\u0151l  a  tursival  a\nkez\u00e9be.\n\nUnless  you  speak  Serbian  (or  a  Slavonic  language),  it  is  hard  work  deciphering  the  meaning  of  the\nsentence in (2).

Of course, for\na speaker of English this has no bearing on their knowledge of the language. A little bit of French or\nLatin has never resulted in any child not being able to master the language if it was exposed to it with\nthe help of its environment. The example in (4) is English in its full glory (and not French or Latin or\nGreek). Areal linguistics will tell you that English has acquired (= \u2018borrowed\u2019) an immense amount of\nlexical items from a number of languages close by or further away (French being just one of these). The\nlanguage has also acquired a substantial amount of words from Latin and Greek not through language\ncontact but learned borrowing (with the help of sciences that looked to Latin or Greek for vocabulary).\nAll this has shaped English into what we can observe today. As you can see, areal linguistics will be\nable to compare any language with any other provided it has had an impact on the language you analyse.\nAs you can see, words themselves are no ground for claiming that English is a dialect of French (or\nalternatively that French is a dialect of English).\n\n           Similarly, Hungarian has not only acquired the means of expressing perfectivity with prefixes,\nbut also an immense amount of words from its neighbours.

It\nis also common knowledge in linguistic circles that the Romance and the Germanic languages are also\nsimilar to each other (at an even \u2018deeper\u2019 level), and so on and so forth until the final circle of comparison\nis made to the effect that English and French and Latin and Greek and Sanskrit and Russian and Persian\n(Farsi) and Armenian and Albanian (and a fair deal of others) are all more similar to each other than\nthey are to any other language outside this circle (like Hungarian, Finnish, Turkish, Basque or Chinese).\nWhat  we  have  now  done  is  give  an  insight  into  what  perspectives  comparing  languages  from  a\ngenealogical perspective may open up. This is the territory of historical (or diachronic) linguistics. From\nwhat we have said so far it should be obvious that perceived similarities between words themselves are\nno guarantee that any two languages will be more closely related to each other than they are to any\nother  where  the  casual  observer  sees  no  similarities.  Claiming  that  Hungarian  and  English  are\n\u2018genetically\u2019 related because of the similarities in words is simply missing the point big time.\n\n           Diachronic linguistics is not commonly referred to as genealogical linguistics because strictly\nspeaking  it  does  not  deal  with  genes  (genes  being  the  repositories  of  inherited  information  from  a\nbiological perspective). Languages are above and beyond genes in the traditional biological sense, so\nany child with any genetic (racial) background can learn any language whatsoever (a Caucasoid learns\nRussian just as easily as an Australoid). It also seems that any child with any genetic makeup can acquire\nany number of unrelated languages making them a bilingual or a multilingual child. From what we have\nsaid  it  follows  that,  in  a  diachronic  analysis,  languages  cannot  just  be  analysed  indiscriminately  (a\ntypological  or  areal  analysis  allows  for  any  two  languages  to  be  compared  at  any  level  (syntactic,\nmorphological, lexical), as shown above). It would appear that relatedness between languages is more\nthan  skin  deep,  but  how  can  it  be  accessed  if  it  is  difficult  to  spot  and  interpret?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3857, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "979fbe33-2e56-4308-b6de-bb242f600fb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "979fbe33-2e56-4308-b6de-bb242f600fb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf8a2c14-3629-4d38-a5b9-0d26aa6860c2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b0c7705359631a68d0f4c25012c2c1f88f2e1a2709f80b8c3812768b52f2c76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aae69ff4-89cb-4c50-8296-0459361f5759", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e8fa7f2d23a99895787272b5d95831170c47dc8a1fe4b1e1a7fba759537ab59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "It also seems that any child with any genetic makeup can acquire\nany number of unrelated languages making them a bilingual or a multilingual child.

To be able to ascertain what happened here the analyst must be able to form generalisations\nalong  the  if  this \u2192  then  that  /  _under  this  and  that  condition_  continuum;  after  all,  one  wants  to\ndemonstrate that when we have this in English, we expect to find that in German under this and that\ncondition. So what are these components? As far as the set of limited data in (5a) shows English seems\nto have no nasals when these are followed by a voiceless fricative. German seems to have pre\u2011fricative\nnasals, but seems to lack \u03b8 (for which it has d, as in Zahnd). Some words have lost this final d (Zahn).\nEnglish has long vowels (more precisely diphthongs) today in five, goos and tooth (but not in soft, dust\nand us). Old English has long monophthnogs. These details are missed by the casual observer.\n\n          What do we make of all this? Is this haphazard? The answer must be in the negative. We can\npropose that at some time in its history English developed a tendency for deleting its nasals before a\nvoiceless fricative. Phonologically this can be explained as the loss of a non\u2011continuant (= stop) nasal\nbefore a continuant (here fricative) sound. After the loss of the nasals, their positions did not disappear,\nhowever. Through a process of compensatory lengthening the vowels before these now\u2011lost nasals were\nlengthened. If the nasals were followed by another non\u2011continuant (=  stop), they were preserved (see\nexamples in (5b)). This explains half the data for English in (5a), as measured against (5b).\n\n          What about those words that have a short vowel nowadays? If our analysis is any good, we will\nhave to provide  (or at least attempt)  an explanation for this. In us the vowel is short because in this\nlanguage function words have no lexical stress (but may acquire it at sentence level) and may also lose\ncontrastive length (that is, they may end up with a lexical short vowel, which doesn\u2019t alternate with a\nlong one, not even if it is stressed emphatically). This is what happened here: us used to have a long\nvowel (for which we have textual evidence from Old and Middle English: in Old English it was \u016bs, in\n\n                                                    ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3337, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0ddea9b-5041-4b68-86e1-cea47fb993e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0ddea9b-5041-4b68-86e1-cea47fb993e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e527d39-3768-420f-be16-ffa9cc0bc1a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "449928933645a4d4f2d4179ad6de8fec9960537c4444643868eb3e405778717c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Middle English ous with <ou> showing a long vowel, similarly to <ou> in house). In modern English\nus  has  a short  vowel, both  when  it is  unstressed  (\u0259s)  and  emphatically  stressed  (\u0259 s),  see  Chapter  on\nintonation on this. We must say that we have no evidence for us containing a long vowel in modern\nEnglish (at some point the word lost its long vowel and was relexicalised with a short vowel).\n\n           In soft we can invoke a phonotactic constraint: in English, only short vowels can be found before\na non\u2011coronal consonant cluster, which is still true today (\u014fctopus, l\u012dmp, tr\u016dmp, \u014fptical, \u0103mber, etc.)\nwith very few counterexamples (ch\u0101mber, C\u0101mbridge, s\u0113\u012bsmograph, tr\u0103ipse, etc.). See Chapter 1 for\nmore explanation on this.\n\n           This leaves us with dust, which is difficult to explain because the word is a lexical word (and as\nsuch is not expected to lose vowel length) and the st cluster is coronal, so a long vowel should be allowed\nhere. We have seen in this course, however, that sC clusters are unpredictable (you may remember that\nit is a lexical property of any given word how a sC is syllabified: Nebraska is Nebr\u00e1s$ka, but \u00f3rchestra\nis \u00f3rche$stra as shown by stress assignment, see Chapter on stress). We have to conclude that the same\napplies to the length of vowels before st clusters: the vowel is either long or short; in dust it happens to\nbe short today, although it could be long as well; there is no phonotactic restriction on the length of the\nvowel). Note that in Old English the vowel was indeed long (d\u016bst), as expected, showing that dust was\nre\u2011lexicalised with a short vowel after Old English. After all, there is nothing phonologically at odds\nwith a long vowel (or diphthong) before a coronal sC\u2011cluster (oust, post, Geist, etc.).\n\n           There  are  other  observations  as  well:  German  lost  \u03b8  and  has  now   .  This  is  true  for  every\nGerman word, as every \u03b8 was regularly displaced by   (cf. think, as opposed to denken; that, as opposed\nto das, etc.). Note also that German has no mb clusters: it has <mm> m now. This is true for every\nhistorical *mb in German (compare En lamb to G Lamm going back to *lamb\u2011, comb to G Kamm going\nback  to  *kamb\u2011; timber  to G  Zimmer  \u2018room\u2019).  Note that  an asterisk (*) shows  reconstructed  data  in\nhistorical linguistics, NOT ungrammatical data. Double asterisks (**) show ungrammatical data.\n\n           A few important questions must be asked and answered. Which language is more conservative,\ni.e. closer to the original state of affairs? It is German, but why? Why can\u2019t we say that German decided\nto insert nasals before its fricatives at some point? Because in historical linguistics inserting something\nis \u2018more expensive\u2019 than deleting something, meaning that every insertion must be  very  carefully\nweighed (= motivated/explained) against the conditioning environment. There is nothing that motivates\nthe insertion of nasal before fricatives. There are hundreds of words where there is no nasal before the\nfricative  (schaffen  \u2018make\u2019, **schamfen,  lesen  \u2018read\u2019, **lensen,  etc.).  There  also  are  words  with  a\nfricative in this position (uns \u2018use\u2019, f\u00fcnf, Kunst \u2018art\u2019, etc.). It seems that German has no problems with\nnasals  before  fricatives.  Deletion  of  the  nasals  in  English  has  been  motivated  as  the  loss  of  a  non\u2011\ncontinuant nasal before a continuant fricative, which seems to be a natural and recurrent process in other\n\n                                                     ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 11", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3553, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "883b4c8a-354e-4c75-8f4d-077faaec1ea8": {"__data__": {"id_": "883b4c8a-354e-4c75-8f4d-077faaec1ea8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fac0aa5-9b2c-440f-ae7b-9355ccce951d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c6add7ec4f27823d3a4dc78338a0a72129a1642a508a8d024966c46c6bc1946", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "languages as well (in Hungarian, n is lost before all continuants, including the fricatives: honfi \u2018patriot\u2019\nwith a long, nasalised vowel \u0254\u0303\u02d0.\n\n           There is an important consequence of this analysis. If the loss of nasals before fricatives is what\ncharacterises English, and if rules are understood as they should; that is, as rules applying to all possible\ninputs at a given time, there should be no nasals before fricatives in English at all. This is not borne out\nby the data: nymph, lymph, anthem, Kensington, pansy, lens, and the list continues. Is this the end of our\nanalysis? Fortunately, this is not the case. We must conclude that rules (or rather their lifecycles) are\nfickle: they appear and they disappear for no obvious reason. Everything is born, it lasts for a limited\ntime and then dies. The same applies to rules. The nasal loss rule above operated a long time ago (over\nalmost 1500 years ago). We must conclude that all those words that we gave as counterexamples are not\na problem, because they arrived (well) after the nasal loss rule had run its course. Historical linguistics\nis replete with such cases: words surviving rules not because they were stronger in any imaginable way\nthan  the  rules  but  because  they  arrived  (=  were  borrowed)  later  than  the  rule(s)  for  which  they  are\nsupposed counterexamples.\n\n           If you are still unconvinced, you probably want to ask how we know that words like  anthem\nentered the language after the nasal loss rule? We know this from a number of sources: in Old English\ntexts anthem, pansy and the like are never found. You may express your disbelief and say that perhaps\nexactly those texts are missing where these words would amply be found. There would appear to be no\nreason for this, however, given the fact that all words in (5a) are amply recorded in old texts. We don\u2019t\nsee why Old English scribes would have left out exactly those words where there occurred a nasal before\na fricative. What\u2019s more, we also know that words like pansy are of French origin (coming from Old\nFrench penser \u2018think\u2019) and these start appearing in the language well after the period we are discussing\nhere. Words like lymph and nymph are of learned origin appearing in the age of enlightenment or later.\nAll this seems to cement the fact that the nasal loss rule was a reality at some distant point in the history\nof English.\n\n            So, what do we have to show for all this? By comparing cognates,4 i.e., words that can be traced\nto  a  common  origin,  we  can  conclude  (with  some  simplification)  that  English  and  German  can  be\nregarded as each other\u2019s \u2018sisters\u2019 pointing to a more distant common relative (a \u2018mother\u2019) in the past, a\nlanguage from which both developed over the time. This proto-language is known as West Germanic.\nWe can push our frontiers even further. If we compare English, German, Frisian, Dutch, Afrikaans with\nDanish, Swedish and the rest of the  northern Germanic languages, we will see that there are further\nphonological regularities at work giving us a North\u2011Western Germanic language family.

Whether the\nforms reconstructed for this ancient language ever existed in the form in which they are reconstructed\nmust remain a matter of philosophical speculation, analytical bias or a combination of the two.6 The\ndrive  to  reconstruct  Indo\u2011European  (and  the  ways  in  which  this  can  be  achieved)  has  resulted  in\nthousands of books and analyses over the last 200 years. How far we can get back in time? Not too far.\n4000\u20114500 years is where reconstructive analysis stops for one obvious reason: after this point all data\nbecome overly speculative. Claiming that Indo\u2011European and Ugro\u2011Finnic (a large language family that\ncomprises Hungarian and Finnish) are related based on 5 vowels and 9 consonants is too weak: the five\ncardinal vowels i, e, a, o, u, voiceless stops, nasals, glides and a liquid are found in (almost) all languages\nand thus provide no incontestable proof of relatedness.\n5 Note that English, again, borrowed punch from this source, punch being originally composed of five key ingredients:\nalcohol, sugar, lemon, water, and tea or spices. Thus five and punch are cognates at a very deep level of analysis.\n6 Note on how many points analyses differ even for current modern English, a language that is all too easy to observe\nand for which massive amounts of sound recordings exist (the whole course has been devoted to the issue of how\nmany possible analyses there can be for any given problem). This is why Indo-European, a language so far removed in\ntime and for which no manuscripts will ever be found, is so excruciatingly difficult to analyse.\n\n                                                     ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3393, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0c11144-139e-4188-a66e-8ed854d12d3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0c11144-139e-4188-a66e-8ed854d12d3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f7c993b-2dc7-4338-b5d9-346cd07a7d0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6328e0863ba837cde06fb678e2f1403d316d6eb0abdddcb4c85ad00df0813e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We have arrived at an important crossroads.

These are important cornerstones in any analysis.\n\n           As you can see, by comparing words (phonological bodies of morphemes) that are cognates we\narrive at a common proto\u2011language provided that the two languages are related, of course.

It  is  important  to\nunderstand  that  the  notion  \u2018the more different they are\u2019  means  \u2018if the  difference  between  two\nlanguages can be showed to regularly derive from the application of ordered phonological rules\u2019.\nHaving two wildly different words is no proof of their relatedness.

So, are\nEnglish and German not languages, but rather dialects? The answer depends on your point of view. For\na historical linguist a language is virtually the same as a dialect (of a now extinct dialect, which in turn\nmay be the dialect of yet another extinct dialect, and so on ad infinitum). If you want to stick to the\ndistinction between language and dialect, that distinction will mainly have to be established on a non\u2011\nlinguistic basis. The basis will be routed in a social, cultural, military, naval or any other  supremacy\ndifference between the entities of which you want to elevate one to the status of an (official) language.\n\n           In  Germany,  for  example,  there  are  several  dialects  (all  with  their  own  rules  of  grammar,\nincluding pronunciation), but there is southern German (centred originally around Bavaria), which used\nto be just another dialect until it was given official language status in the 19th century. This was done for\npractical reasons: a huge, unified country had to be run efficiently with a system of  border\u2011to\u2011border\nlaw\u2011making, effective administration, etc. Max Weinreich, a Yiddish scholar, said that \u201ca language is\na dialect with an army and a navy,\u201d expressing very succinctly the fact how linguistically arbitrary\nthis classification is (and how non\u2011arbitrary it is from a power\u2011based point of view). Once a country\ngains independence and/or takes power into its own hands, a language is suddenly born (Czech and\nSlovak are now popularly regarded to be two different languages, as are Serbian and Croatian, but for a\nhistorical  linguist  they  are  just  dialects  of  an  extinct  language/dialect).    We  must  conclude  that  the\ndifference between language and dialect is mainly political.\n\n           Yet, we have practical reasons to introduce another term, accent. It is used to describe dialects\n(languages) that have very similar (or identical) grammars and mainly differ in pronunciation, as is the\ncase with Southern Standard British English (SSBE), General American (GA), South American English,\nand so on. As you can see English and German, or English and Russian are not referred to as two accents\nof the same language, because the differences (both phonological and non\u2011phonological) are just too\nsubstantial for them to be regarded as the \u2018same language\u2019. SSBE and GA, however, can be referred to\nas accents of the same (rather abstract) language we call English. There is no \u2018one English\u2019, there are\nonly various  accents  of  it, or  various \u2018Englishes\u2019. For a historical linguist, of course, all the various\nEnglishes can be shown to have developed from one common source with the application of (a rather\nlong series of) phonological rules (or at least this is how it can be envisaged linguistically). All Englishes\nare historically related to each other though through common origin, leading back to West Germanic.\n\n           We have worked our way through a substantial amount of information to realise that change has\nalways been a central notion in the description of languages. The languages we see today are full of\nchanges  happening  just  now,  which  means  that  we  are  witnesses  to  how  new  accents  (and  given\nconsiderable time, even dialects; and given even more time and space, languages) may develop.

Some changes are minor, some may appear\nmore substantial. The question of which of these changes will ultimately become a differentiating feature\nof one accent as opposed to another is anyone\u2019s guess. Linguistics can predict which direction a change\nmay take based on what we have observed in the world\u2019s languages, but whether it really will go down\na certain path cannot be predicted with certainty. Some changes will become entrenched in one language\nbut not in another, and so on.

In the photo in (9) you can see three changes happening at the same time (two of these have\nalready started interacting, and there is every likelihood that they will mix with the third ripple of change\nas well). In linguistics the lake is the population that speaks a given language, the ripples are initiated\nby  the  same  population  of  speakers.  The  abstract  boundaries  of  a  sound  change  are  shown  with  an\nisogloss  (iso  meaning  equal/same  and  gloss  meaning  word  in  Greek).

So, maps\n                    like the ones below will be based on words like bath and sun (two words that have been in the language\n                    since Germanic times), course (a word that entered English from French at least 500 years ago, before\n                    it branched off into GA or SSBE), but not banana, basil, sushi, sachet, gateau, jalapeno, quesadilla,\n                    chinchilla, chihuahua or the like that are viewed as relatively recent borrowings that have entered GA\n                    and SSBE separately on separate occasions (more on this below). This is crucial: words referred to\n                    above like bath, sun and course did not enter GA and SSBE separately on separate occasions, these\n                    words were present together (= they are cognates) in an earlier mother language from which both GA\n                    and SSBE develop.\n\n                               Note the difference between GA and SSBE basil: b\u025bjz\u0259l in the former, baz\u0259l in the latter. The\n                    differences in pronunciation cannot be explained by assuming that these words come from a common\n                    source (= a mother language). There is no way for accounting for the differences between the two vowels\n                    using the phonological rules we are familiar with from historical  phonological analysis. We have to\n                    conclude that basil entered GA and SSBE separately (= the word didn\u2019t exist in the mother language\n                    from  which  both  GA  and  SSBE  developed),  and  as  such  cannot  be  used  to  establish  isoglosses.  If,\n                    however, an accent of GA (let us call it GA2 spoken in the Rockies) ultimately came to develop a rule\n                    that changed every \u025bj to aj, we would say that basil could then be used for an isogloss differentiating\n                    between GA1 and GA2. Why? Because both GA1 basil (with \u025bj) and GA2 basil (with aj) come from a\n                    common  mother  language/dialect  (GA).  As  you  can  see,  we  have  just  applied  the  same  historical\n                    principle to a hypothetical example. It seems that historical analysis and dialectology are the heads and\n                    tails of the same linguistic coin.\n\n                    4.2 Major variables used in the classification of English accents in the UK\n\n\u2022     R\u2011dropping\n\u2022     H\u2011dropping\n\u2022     FOOT\u2011STRUT split\n\u2022     NG\u2011coalescence (phoneme\u2011hood of \u014b)\n\u2022     FACE\u2011GOAT diphtongisation\n\u2022     BATH\u2011TRAP split\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 19", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 20, "end_char_idx": 3419, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72094073-4d67-485f-8855-2e540810b2fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "72094073-4d67-485f-8855-2e540810b2fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8effaab6-0f32-4dac-b96f-6f138972e50a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fdcdbf321094c277142110186fcb871ca5ebef4618ab7e16dff7efb9870753f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "+r\nYou must be aware that the isoglosses shown below will also depend on whether a speaker comes from\na rural or an urban area, on their family background and the education they received.

The short U split in some areas into either \u028a (now found as \u0289 or \u0275 in CuBE, as in bull,\npull, foot, wolf, could, cushion, courier, sugar, butcher and a few others) or \u028c (now generally found as\n\u0259 in CuBE, as in dull, strut, dust, come, love, money). In those areas where there was no such split, the\nvowel is \u028a (bull, dull, come all have \u028a). Note that the split in those area where it occurred produced a\nnew phoneme \u028c (put \u028a and putt \u028c are minimal pairs). Note also that in those areas where such a split\ndidn\u2019t occur, the phoneme (or sound) \u028c is non\u2011existent (it hasn\u2019t been supplied from any other source).\n\n                              ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 21", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 92, "end_char_idx": 1720, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8d704eb-d559-4feb-9783-c3f05fd2198f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8d704eb-d559-4feb-9783-c3f05fd2198f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91652959-6a9e-432f-b665-73ede0e26178", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42226c4c71f5d018c720308d8d509cc5601a1a8c965e51555d3d3e90b66cd5bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "H-Dropping\n                                                                                                                            R-Dropping\n                                                                                                                  FOOT-STRUT Split\n                                                                                                                   NG Coalescence\n                                                             7 U                                                  FACE-Diphthonging\n(13) FOOT\u2011STRUT split\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 NG-coalescence\n\nNG\u2011coalescence simply refers to whether the velar nasal (\u014b) is a phoneme or not.

After the loss of the\nvelar  voiced  stop,  \u014b  became  a  phoneme  (its  presence  is  now  unpredictable  and  it  now  distinguishes\nwords, as in sing \u2013 sin \u2013 sim).

At some point in the history of the\nlanguage there appeared a phonological change that lengthened every *a before a voiceless fricative that\nwas either word\u2011final of followed by a consonant (= fricative in coda position), see (19a) in Accent 2. If\nthe fricative was followed by a vowel (= fricative in onset) in the same word (but not across a #\u2011boundary\nas in pass#ing), the lengthening failed, as in (19b(i)) (compare class \u0251\u02d0 to classify a). Lengthening also\nfailed if the short vowel was followed by any other consonant (19b(ii)). We can blame this on a rule\nshown in (20). In Accent 1 nothing happened.\n\n(20) BATH\u2011lengthening\n\na \u2192 a\u02d0 / __ Fric(\u2212voi)#,  __Fric(\u2212voi)C (voiceless fricatives: f \u03b8 s \u0283\n\n,303\n\n)\n\nThe rule produced a segment (a\u02d0) that was an allophone of short a in Accent 2. This can be regarded as\nphonetic lengthening, something that stayed invisible to phonology (the language did not acquire a new\nphoneme  as  its  occurrence  was  predictable,  as  shown  by  (20)).  To  complicate  matters  somewhat,  it\nseems that this long a\u02d0 developed into two qualitatively different vowels, a\u02d0 and \u0251\u02d0 (there was no change\naffecting the short vowel, which stayed an open low short a) in the accents we show as 2.1 and 2.2\nabove. This qualitative change also remained invisible to phonology, a new phoneme did not come into\nexistence.\n\n           However, there was another change underway that we will discuss at length later: R\u2011deletion,\nwhich did result in a new phoneme being added to the system (cat kat vs cart k\u0251\u02d0t). Now there suddenly\narose a minimal pair: the difference between cat and cart now hinged only on the difference in the two\nvowels.\n\n           The distribution of a and \u0251\u02d0 before voiceless fricatives, however, was still predictable at this\nstage  (before  coda  fricatives  there  was  a  long  low  vowel,  before  onset  fricatives  it  was  a  short  low\nvowel). In other words, the existing phonemic opposition between short and long A was  neutralised\nbefore coda fricatives (the vowel here could only be long: class) and before onset fricatives as well (the\nvowel here could only be short: classify). (You may remember other neutralisations in the language as\nwell: s and \u0283 are two phonemes of the language (sin vs shin), but before r only \u0283 can occur (shrew, but\nnot **srew), which allows us to say that the phonemic difference between s and \u0283 before r is neutralised\ninto \u0283.)\n\n           We have a bit of a conundrum here: how did the split happen? Why do we feel that this once\nallophonic/predictable difference between the vowels differentiates words now? It seems that what used\nto be complementary distribution at one stage ceased to be complementary at another due to analogy\nbased on alternations involving the two vowels. The word class, for example, had two alternants: one\n                                                    ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2979, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15d30f95-70f5-476a-bd17-719f236188c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "15d30f95-70f5-476a-bd17-719f236188c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aec15ef2-28e0-4ae5-9f68-da1d892a3344", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ca265d48b7b5a897d34909ac35e6bd0d6b2840b6c833991da67e13f04aa4536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "with a short A (classify a) and one with a long A (class \u0251\u02d0). It seems that complementary distribution\nceased by the transference of the short vowel into the position which was originally occupied by the\nlong vowel (mass a \u2018quantity of matter\u2019 now has a short vowel instead of a long one, influenced by\nmassive a that has always had a short vowel). The same happened to math, which was influenced by\nmathematical.7 You see now that pass(#ing/#ed/#er/#able) \u0251\u02d0 \u2013 passenger a \u2013 passive a \u2011 passion a (all\ncontaining the same stem) preserve the original distinction (and distribution). There is no explanation\nas to why pass has not been influenced by passenger. This is a choice that this accent made at some\npoint (a choice which may be reversed in the future).\n\n           Not everything can be explained so neatly. The words mass \u2018holy service\u2019 and Basque can have\nboth a long and short vowel (= free variation). Words like lass, bass \u2018perch\u2019, ass \u2018donkey\u2019, lash have\nshort vowels, while ass \u2018backside\u2019 usually has a long vowel, as does moustache. The same is true for\nwords  in  which  the  fricative  was  followed  by  a  consonant:  ask,  task,  mask,  cask,  rascal  have  long\nvowels,  mascot,  asp,  Bafta  have  short  ones.    One  possible  explanation  is  that  these  words  were\n\u2018reborrowed\u2019 from those accents in which  the  BATH\u2011lengthening  never  happened  (the  non\u2011South\u2011\nEastern accents). Bafta, of course, is too modern a word to be reborrowed. Here we must conclude that\nthe rule of BATH\u2011lengthening is dead as a rule, it ran its course and is no longer active. New words (of\nany source) are no likely to be affected.\n\n           It is also possible that BATH\u2011lengthening did not run its full course (= it did not affect all the\neligible words of the lexicon). We will not investigate this here. Another very likely possibility is that\nsome  of  these  words  are  learned  or  recent  borrowings,  coming  into  the  language  after  BATH\u2011\nlengthening had run its course (remember a similar example in connection with anthem). The rule, when\nit was active, and the processes of analogy and reborrowing that followed have resulted in an arbitrary\n(lexical) distribution of a/\u0251\u02d0 (= you have to remember which word in this particular category has which\nvowel). What used to be allophonic variation before voiceless fricatives is now a phonemic fact. We\nwill see further examples for this as we proceed.\n\n           The  term  split  may  appear  slightly  misleading  because  although  this  is  a  split  in  the\npronunciation of the original vowel, the path to the appropriate vowel in modern English is unpredictable\nat the present stage of the language. Split must be understood as phonemic (\u2018unexplained\u2019) split. If you\nfind  a  word  which  ends  in  \u2011ast,  \u2011ask,  \u2011asp,  the  quality  of  the  vowel  is  unpredictable  (it  has  to  be\nremembered;  it  is  a  lexical  matter  of  the  word  in  question).  Note,  however,  the  following:  while\nphonological  analogy  may  have  replaced  a  long  vowel  (\u0251\u02d0)  with  a  short  one (a)  in  words  having  a\nvoiceless  fricative  in  constant  coda  position  (clasp  \u0251\u02d0  vs  asp a)  or  in  words  in  which  the  voiceless\nfricative was either in onset or in coda position in the same morpheme depending on alternation (mass\n\u2018weight\u2019 now with a short vowel, influenced by massive where the vowel was always short, as opposed\n7 But note aftermath with \u0251  (at least for some speakers) of CuBE.\n\n                                                    ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 28", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3559, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23d24299-0405-4375-897e-d8bf713929e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "23d24299-0405-4375-897e-d8bf713929e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30203dac-9759-4301-a4be-8ff5546a5027", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98d47dc8b17ef98ec1ce49881e12a03b7e4678b3408fe9c5882e915315b68fdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "to pass, which kept the long vowel), the long vowel has not been analogically extended to alternants\nwith the fricative in onset position (passive and massive with a, but never \u0251\u02d0).\n\n           Words that have either never had a fricative in coda position (hat, map, lag have never had a\nlong vowel and they have been kept that way) are really our control group where nothing interesting\nhappens.

The\nFOOT\u2011STRUT split, the BATH\u2011TRAP split and FACE/GOAT\u2011diphthonging are taken to be the great\naccentual dividing lines between the South and the North of England.\n\n5     R in the history of English\n\nA major part of this chapter owes its existence to a sonorant consonant, namely the rhotic, i.e. r. Before\nwe look at a series of changes set off by this consonant, let us first discuss where it can occur in the\nmajor accents of English.\n\n5.1 The positions of R\n\nIn what follows we will be using R to refer to an R which is historical, i.e., which was present in the\nlanguage  from  at  least  Middle  English  times.  This  R  may  have  undergone  deletion  (in  non\u2011rhotic\naccents), but is still present in rhotic accents. As you know by now, English spelling is very conservative\nand preserves such (now non\u2011existent) R\u2019s (e.g., art). Some of these R\u2019s are non\u2011recoverable (e.g., art),\nbut  word\u2011final R\u2019s are recoverable (e.g., This  car  is  automatic).  Of  course,  in  rhotic  accents  every\nhistorical R is still present. Let us first look at the environments where R can be found today. We will\nbe referring to pronounced rhotics as r (this may be a historical or linking R in non\u2011rhotic accents, but\nmay also be intrusive r, a rhotic that was inserted into words at some point after Middle English). Let\u2019s\nlook at (22) now.\n\n                                                      ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 2553, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "957327c5-f787-45b0-a4f6-16f8ef709f46": {"__data__": {"id_": "957327c5-f787-45b0-a4f6-16f8ef709f46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1969264-0f0a-43b6-b074-2e95deb33281", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "712573913d87c290d66b5ee2b055f444ccd806d82301c9a79562b17aeef5df41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Chicago                                                            Boston          London                  New Orleans\n                                                                                       AmE)                                                              BrE)\n            rat                                                                                                                                                                               V, #_v\n             era                                                                                                                                                                         V_v\n(22) Environments of r tar                                                                                                                                                            X       #\n             art\n                                                                         rhotic                                    semirhotic            nonrhotic             'supernonrhotic'\n\n\nIf you analyse (22) you will see that the only position where r is stable is the word\u2011initial position (either\nbefore a stressed vowel (V ) or an unstressed vowel (v)). Note also that semi\u2011rhotic accents (like East\u2011\nCoast/New England old\u2011fashioned American) show that the word\u2011final position is stronger than word\u2011\ninternal coda position: in the former r can still be found (tar), but not in the latter (art). It seems we also\nhave a hierarchy of strength for r\u2011deletion: if r is lost word\u2011internally before an unstressed vowel (era),\nit means it will be lost in all the other positions as well, and so on, according to the strength hierarchy\nof positions: rat > era > tar > art. It also follows that we don\u2019t expect to find accents in which the r is\nretained in art, but not in tar.\n\n      In SSBE r must be followed by either a vowel or a syllabic consonant to be pronounced (see the\nChapter on syllables in this course). In the history of SSBE there occurred a change that deleted word\u2011\nfinal  pre\u2011pausal  r  (This  is  made  of  tar)  and  pre\u2011consonantal  r  (I  like  art).  This  seems  a  rather\nstraightforward process, you would think. It is and it isn\u2019t because the loss of the rhotic is bound up with\nat least two other processes, Broadening and Breaking.

The apparently obvious answer is that it is R, that is a historical R, which has been around\nfrom Middle English times. This R is, it seems, a r which has never been deleted because it was shielded\noff from deletion by the vowel\u2011initial word after it (see (22)).\n\n(22) R or r?\n\nthis car is automatic dis ka:r                                                                                            IZ o.tomatik\n                              ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 62, "end_char_idx": 3098, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b17ee46-50bb-4e43-8818-d01fa2fbfd98": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b17ee46-50bb-4e43-8818-d01fa2fbfd98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e40a36d-861e-4ac3-8fe4-8819c8bd6e0c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec2c5df3bee78402f9d537cbaac849cb3f6b913afbdb710158732c94566fb549", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Reality, however, is more interesting than fiction because we have a number of reasons to believe that\nthis R is actually not R (the historical R), but r (a \u2018new\u2019 rhotic inserted by a rule after Middle English).\nLet\u2019s look at why we should think that the r at the end of car is not R.\n\n5.2.1 Reason 1 for claiming r is not R in car\n\nThe loss of R after a stressed vowel results in compensatory lengthening, i.e., the lengthening of the\nvowel after which there used to be an R in word\u2011internal coda position (see (23)).\n\n(23) Compensatory lengthening\n\ncard kard                                                                                    ka d, fork fork                             fok,       hurt hart  ha t\nOur control group is found in (24), words in which deletion of R has never happened and the vowel has\nremained short.\n\n(24) Absence of compensatory lengthening\n\ncarry karij, foreign foran ,                                                                                  hurry      horij\nWhen word\u2011final R is lost, the vowel also lengthens (see (25)).\n\n(25) Compensatory lengthening after loss of word\u2011final R\n   car kar                                                          ka: _                       for for              fo: ,      her har        ha:\nOne may think that if R is recovered as r before vowel\u2011initial words, that would mean the undoing of\ncompensatory lengthening (that is, a short vowel is expected before R), see (26)).\n\n(26) There is no undoing of compensatory lengthening\n\ncar is kar IZ, for it fo r t, her odds har odz\nHowever, our expectations are not borne out: we have both a long vowel and r.

What other reasons do we have for\nsupposing that recovered R is actually r, that is a non\u2011historical rhotic? Let us look at reason 2.\n\n5.2.1 Reason 2 for claiming r is not R in car\n\nFor SSBE there is perfect regularity when r must be inserted after those words which have no R (that\nis, historical R).

This is because of a\nrule (set out in (29)) that took over the regularity of the pronunciation of word\u2011final pre\u2011vocalic r. The\nrhotic r is automatically inserted by a rule after long vowels and schwa of SSBE. For this reason, these\nvowels are known as R vowels.\n\n(29) r\u2011insertion rule\n\n0 \u2192 r / V\u02d0# __ V (V = R\u2011vowels: long monophthongs and schwa) \u02d0\n\nLet us review what we have come to see so far (see (30)).\n(30) Conclusions the                             in ka:r                                   IZ is not the historica                                       R of car\n                word-final R is always lost in                                                                                   nonrhotic accent\n                what looks like a                                                                                   'recovered'  is in fact an automatically inserted\n                there is no lexical r ~ $ alternation in English\n\nIt seems then that in a non\u2011rhotic accent there is no historical R word\u2011finally.

Before coda R the historical short non\u2011low vowels all merged into schwa (spirt = serf = burn = hurt\n\u2260 tar \u2260 port).  Before onset R lax vowels keep their quality just as they do before any other consonant\n(spirit  =  spit,  serif  =  set,  bull  =  Buryat,  hut  =  hurry).  The  only  vowel  that  mergers  differently  is\nhistorical short a, which is found as \u025b before onset R (tarry \u2260 tar).\n\n           Note also a change independent of R in GA: lax \u0254 is generally only possible before coda R (port,\nboard), not before any other consonant, including onset R. So, words like lot, cot, shot, lorry, porridge,\nhot,  because,  dog  all  have  \u0251  in  GA  (where  SSBE  would  normally  have  \u0254).  It  is  only  dialectally\n(especially in East Coast/New England American) that lax \u0254 is found before voiceless fricatives (as in\ncloth, loss, lost) and before onset R (as in porridge and oral), and also in some other positions (call,\nthought, daunt, law). In GA these all have \u0251. Historically, the vowel in pot (\u0251) is a new development in\nGA (it used to be \u0254), as compared to \u0254 in port, and porridge (where R acted as a protective environment,\npreventing it from becoming \u0251 in New England American). Note that spelling is very conservative: pot\nstill has the lax \u2018o\u2019 vowel that it did historically.  However, not even in GA does the \u2018once tense\u2019 \u0254\nbecome \u0251 before onset R (oral, story, etc. still have \u0254), see summary in (35b) where the shaded areas\nshow identical vowels in GA and conservative New England English.\n\n           The traditional name for the combined effects of the first nurse merger and the backing of the\nhistorical a vowel before coda r (tar) are known as pre-R broadening (compare tap vs tar, set vs serf,\nsit vs spirt, to which we can add hut/burn where the change was vacuous). Pre\u2011R broadening is also\nextended to the failure of \u0254 becoming \u0251 before coda R (port \u0254, never \u0251). So, first nurse merger + laxing\nof a to \u0251 + failure of \u0254 to become \u0251 before coda R = pre-R broadening.\n\n           Note a further effect that onset R has had on lax a and \u025b, as well as tense e before it: all of these\nhave merged into lax \u025b, so marry merry Mary have the same stressed vowel in GA (as opposed to SSBE\nwhere we have different vowels: m[a]rry m[\u025b]rry M[\u025b\u02d0]ry). Let\u2019s call it the MARRY MERRY MARY\nmerger (36). As a conclusion we can say that the 11 non\u2011diphthongal vowels before C (\u2260 r) reduces in\nnumber to 6 before r (see (37a)). But do we ever have a diphthong before r? The answer is yes. The\nwide diphthongs can still be found before the rhotic (see (37b)). As you can see, GA has no diphthongs\nother than the wide diphthongs. The same is true for SSE.\n\n(36) MARRY MERRY MARY MERGER\n\na, \u025b, e, rV \u2192 \u025brV\n\n                                                    ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 38", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2902, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26df6c63-4a07-43a0-939f-a49dc52e52f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "26df6c63-4a07-43a0-939f-a49dc52e52f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d0f4489-91a4-4e56-9958-289dfccdde4a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dca076df3c2019ceaf140848960757e4c12356e5e484d4fac593ead89ebadd42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(37) Vowel contrasts\n\n(a) Vowel contrasts before r in GA8\n                           vowels that occur before r:                                                                             1 \u20ac a 3 ) U\n                           vowels that do not occur before r: i e 3 0 U\n\n(b) The wide diphthongs before r in GA and SSE\n\n                                     __r#                  __rC\n               \u0251j               fire, tire, shire         Ireland\n               oj                    Moir            accidental gap\n              aw                cower, tower,            coward,\n                                      dour               Howard\n\n\n\n\n8 For those with a historical interest in GA. The vowel mergers discussed above didn\u2019t happen in one fell swoop. There\nwere a number of rounds of mergers. In very conservative (possibly no longer existing) American English story, porridge\nand pot had three different vowels at one stage: story o, porridge \u0254 and pot \u0251. It seems the merger first affected the tense\nvowel before onset R making story \u0254 and porridge \u0254 have identical lax vowels. The lax \u2018o\u2019 that was not followed by R\nlowered to \u0251 (pot). In modern GA those lax \u2018o\u2019s that originate in historical lax \u2018o\u2019s can in some accents lower to \u0251 (e.g.,\nporridge, lorry, sorry with \u0251), but those that originate in the tense \u2018o\u2019 do not (e.g., story, notorious seem only to have \u0254, not\n\u0251). Perhaps this distinction is reinforced by spelling. The same distinction once existed in Mary e vs merry \u025b vs marry a.\nToday Mary and merry have a merged lax vowel (\u025b) in GA (but may still have the original distinction is some accents),\nand marry has either \u025b or a (in some accents of GA). The marry merry Mary merger is not yet complete, as you can see.\nHowever, compare this to mare, rare, fair which can only have \u025b (not the historical e). Coda R was a stronger cause of\nmergers than onset R. As you can see, all this variation on the same theme may be a point of difference for a number\nof American accents and may ultimately lead to new languages in the (very distant) future.\n\nNote also that word-final \u0251 in GA which has an origin independent of the rhotic (law, spa) patterns with the tense\nvowels (it can be found word-finally, for example ), but there is another \u0251 (the one originating in pre-R broadening, as\nin car, cart) which is found before the rhotic and patterns with the lax vowels (see (37a)). We have both a tense \u0251 and\na lax \u0251, it seems. Note also that a (as in pat) which cannot be found word-finally and as such patterns with the lax\nvowels, but it cannot be found before r where one would only expect lax vowels (given the overall laxing effect or the\nrhotic). This is a distributional curiosity that we will not discuss.\n\n                                               ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 39", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2814, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3036314e-3eef-426b-8433-19a811f7a9de": {"__data__": {"id_": "3036314e-3eef-426b-8433-19a811f7a9de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "289d9a97-29a7-47a5-9581-c179e3743502", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1ed41b2eaca2efecc1095fe06c88fcde61911d6942d70519ab8354249262e8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R{C,#}                     rV\n                 clean                                                                               I                                     clear                  clearance\n               spit                                                                                                                      spirt                    spirit\n                 cake                                                                          ej                                           care                    Charon\n                set                                                                                                                        serf                   serif\n5.3.3          Southern Standard British English\n                                                 cute                                       UW                                              cure            0;    curious\n5.3.3.1\nThe next major accent on our list is SSBE (or more precisely CuBE).

CuBE, and SSBE in general, has diphthongs instead of tense vowels\nthat we saw in SSE and GA (observe the __C environment). Diphthongs historically come from tense\nvowels.\n\n               What happens if historically lax (short) vowels are followed by coda R? Here the modern vowels\nare long and there is no coda R (spirt, serf, tar, port, burn). This is because of R\u2011dropping (see (48\nbelow),  and  the  chapter  on  syllables  in  this  course).  However,  coda  R  did  not  only  drop  (with\ncompensatory lengthening), it also affected the quality of the preceding lax vowel in a process we have\nalready discussed for GA (first nurse merging) plus backing of a to \u0251, and raising of \u0254 to o. All these\nchanges can collectively be referred to as pre-R broadening. This change is shared by SSBE and GA,\nwhich for a historical linguist means that American English and SSBE are closely related. As always,\nlanguages introduce new rules. SSBE, starting in the 18th century, started applying a rule known as R\u2011\ndropping.  After  R  was  dropped,  the  vowels  underwent  compensatory  lengthening,  resulting  in  long\nbroad vowels (as opposed to GA, where there was no R\u2011dropping and hence the lax vowels are still\nshort, and followed by R, of course). This is why SSBE and GA are still very closely related, but by no\nmeans identical. It also follows that if R was not dropped, the vowel is expected to be short. We\u2019ll see\nif this is borne out by the data.\n\n               It also seems that no diphthongs are possible before R (and r). In BrE R\u2011vowels (= the long\nmonophthongs) can only rarely be motivated synchronically by r. Look at some of the facts in (39).\n\n                                                                          ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 40", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 146, "end_char_idx": 3778, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f6feaec-e62b-47ff-8d5e-3df1fccb6ee1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f6feaec-e62b-47ff-8d5e-3df1fccb6ee1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04bbbd1a-1e6f-47c9-b88e-bf29b0d2829c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "baa13ed02914adcd36f2a34edb8d262068009e9c8040f3451cffb7e0d263d890", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "we find an                             R vowel before R almost always when the R is not\n         pronounced:                                   car ka:,                     card kard\n         an R vowel is the result of compensatory lengthening, which\n(39) Vowels and R in BrE compensates for the loss of R\n         when R is pronounced the                                                                        CARROT-rule'                              applies:                     no compensatory\n        lengthening, no R vowel,                                                                 eg carrot karot, serif serif , spirit spirat (in\n        fact, sbiratl), porridge porid3,                                                                          hurry               harij\n\n\nIt seems when R is not pronounced, the vowel before it lengthens. The opposite also holds: if the R is\npronounced, the vowel is short. This is informally known as the \u2018carrot\u2011rule\u2019: if R was not deleted, the\nvowel before it is short (the word carrot exemplifies this phenomenon).

The examples\nin (40) show that we can find a long vowel even before those Rs that have never been lost. In mono\u2011\nmorphemic Charon the long vowel must be due to another reason.\n\n    We have seen that historical word\u2011internal coda Rs were lost in BrE: words like card, lord, serf\ncontain unrecoverable Rs. There is no possibility of ever recovering them. We have also seen that before\nsuch Rs stressed vowels are long (card, lord, serf). However, it seems vowel length doesn\u2019t entirely\ndepend on R loss: words like Charon have long vowels despite absence of R loss. So, this can\u2019t be the\nwhole story.

All  of  them,\nhowever, undergo smoothing in the same way. Historical schwa and schwa due to insertion before r and\n(more recently before dark) \u0142 result in smoothed vocalic sequences.\n\n        There are a few further changes that must be mentioned: the vowel \u0289\u02d0 (the result of smoothing)\ncan for some speakers lowers to o\u02d0, for some to \u0259\u02d0 before palatals. There is thus a split of \u0289\u02d0 into two\nvowels depending on the place of articulation of the preceding consonant: if the consonant before it is\nnon\u2011palatal, \u0289\u02d0 can optionally lower to o\u02d0 (poor with either \u0289\u02d0 or o\u02d0, as opposed to pure with \u0289\u02d0, o\u02d0 or \u0259\u02d0,\nread more on this in the chapter on diphthongs and the problems surrounding them).\n\n        Another change we have to discuss is syncopation (the loss of an inter\u2011consonantal schwa when\nfollowed by an unstressed vowel), see (52).\n(52) Syncopation Ireland ajaland                                                                       ajlond (=island; also aland)\n ironing ajonin                                                                                  ajnig (also Gwnin)\n  like diamond dajamand                                                                                                                   dajmand (also da:mand)\n   violence vajolons                                                                                              vajlons (also va lans)\n\n\nNote that in Ireland and ironing the schwa is secondary (= inserted in the process of breaking). This\nschwa can be syncopated. As a matter of fact, there is free variation here: some speakers syncopate the\nschwa (and thus undo breaking) or keep the schwa and have smoothing (the result of which is a \u2018smooth\u2019\npronunciation of the triphthongal sequence \u0251j\u0259 as \u0251\u02d0 (or \u0251\u0259). In (50) we said that in word like clearance,\ncurious, firing, fiery, sowerest, towering there is optional breaking (= schwa is only optionally inserted).\nWe now see that the absence of schwa can be explained with syncopation (kl\u026aj\u0259r\u0259ns > kl\u026ajr\u0259ns due to\nsyncopation).\n\n                                   ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 46", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2842, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "606a0772-91f7-4429-b52a-7aa54b5d0daa": {"__data__": {"id_": "606a0772-91f7-4429-b52a-7aa54b5d0daa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd9f817f-e9f7-479b-a920-09d61c7b8e9a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b11a3a5b6bc8bb8c5a924a574a8f58730c785adc96f1f7dffd0744baad7f190", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R vowels in BrE are independent of R (or r)\n                                                                                                                     non-R-vowel                                                                                R vowel\n                                                                                                                   van van                                                                                     vase Va:z\n             not before                                                                                              don don                                                                                    dawn dorn\n                                                                                                                     dip dip                                                                                   idea ajdi:\n                                                                                                                     bum bam                                                                                    Boehm barm\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                varnish vaxnif\nto breaking), which is syncopated before an unstressed vowel.

Look (53) where we have\ncollected all the possible environments where checked (short) vowels and R\u2011vowels can occur.\n(53) Checked vowels vs R\u2011vowels in CUBE                                                                              dirigible diradzobal                                                                      Guevara gova:ra\n             before                                                                                                  burrow baraw                                                                               Dorian do.rijan\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                hero hixraw\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              Goering ga:rin\n\n\nIn (53) you can see that the checked vowels a o \u026a \u0259 and the R\u2011vowels \u0251\u02d0 o\u02d0 \u026a\u02d0 \u0259\u02d0 can be found in the same\nset of environments, both before any consonant that is not R and before R/r. From a synchronic point of\nview, we must say that the checked vowels a o \u026a \u0259 and the R\u2011vowels \u0251\u02d0 o\u02d0 \u026a\u02d0 \u0259\u02d0 are phonemes of the\nlanguage (= you can have minimal pairs with them; they are contrastive in CuBE). Before onset R both\nlong and short vowels can be found (V\u00e1rro a vs Guev\u00e1ra \u0251\u02d0), before coda consonants both short and\nlong vowels can be found (van a vs vase \u0251\u02d0), before onset Cs other than R both short and long vowels\ncan be found (vanish a vs varnish \u0251\u02d0). There are no constraints on the vowels. A constraint that remains\nto this day is the one preventing R from occurring in the coda (= R\u2011dropping), which is why we can\u2019t\nhave any of the free vowels/diphthongs, checked vowels or R\u2011vowels of CuBE before coda R (*b\u0251\u02d0rn,\n*ko\u02d0rn, *p\u025b\u02d0r , *barn, *k\u0254rn, *p\u025brk, *k\u025bjr, *t\u0259wr, *l\u0251jrt, etc.). Of the free vowels (= diphthongs) of\nCuBE only \u025bj and \u0259w can\u2019t be found before onset R (*k\u0259wr\u026aj, *m\u025bjr\u0259), the rest of the diphthongs can\n(see (54)).\n\n                                 ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 47", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 4438, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66da6c9d-1548-44c4-bcc6-3eb3931a63fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "66da6c9d-1548-44c4-bcc6-3eb3931a63fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2399ad5b-02a1-48e2-8a5d-912af1e622ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f341b88b1cc6f06aa7a23ba437636bf8ed08ae7c7ddcabf50deca5553f190f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(54) Distribution of vowels before R in CuBE\n\n    Classes of Vs          __R{#, C}                      __RV\n    checked Vs                 NO                          YES\n                                                       (barrow a)\n    R-vowels                   NO                          YES\n                                                        (tiara \u0251\u02d0)\n    Free Vs                    NO                 YES                NO\n    (diphthongs)                              (serious \u026aj,         *\u0259wrV\n                                                fiery \u0251j,\n                                               Moira oj,            *\u025bjrV\n                                               rural \u0289w)\n\n\n(55) Distribution of vowels before Cs other than R in CuBE\n\n    Classes of Vs             __C#                __CV\n                            (C \u2260 R/r)           (C \u2260 R/r)\n    checked Vs                 YES                 YES\n                             (cat a)           (callous a)\n    R-vowels                   YES                 YES\n                            (vase \u0251\u02d0)          (tomato \u0251\u02d0)\n    Free Vs                    YES                 YES\n    (diphthongs)             (late \u025bj)          (caper \u025bj)\n\n\nTables (54) and (55) summarise what we can say about the distribution of vowels in CuBE before R\nfrom  a  synchronic  point  of  view.

The more diachronic rules you have, the more innovative the accent. It seems that SSBE is the most\ninnovative, SSE the most conservative, while GA is more innovative than SSE, but less so than SSBE.\nA similar (yet far more elaborate) chart can be drawn up for, let\u2019s say, English and German, or English\nand Ancient Greek that would show which language is conservative (and from which aspect). As you\ncan see, the fact that two languages don\u2019t happen to sound similar (or fairly similar) is no reason to\ndiscard the possibility of them being related at some (ancient) level. We can now answer the linguistic\nquestion  of  who  is  more conservative:  The  Queen  or  President  Trump. It\u2019s most certainly President\nTrump because he doesn\u2019t have R\u2011dropping, compensatory lengthening, breaking or smoothing. The\nQueen is very modern and innovative (at least from this perspective).\n\n5.5 A diachronic view of the origin of vowel contrasts\n\nLet\u2019s look at the set of contrasts that all of these developments produce.

What\u2019s more, it is not only native phonological\nsources that produce a new set of contrast, but loans can also result in a new set of oppositions. CuBE\ncan be characterised as having massive (historical) mergers. To this can be added a new set of mergers\nthat involve the vocalisation of dark\u2011L (ball > o\u02d0 < bore, full, bull > \u0289w < foo, boo, mull > \u0259w < mow,\netc., read on this in the Chapter on diphthongs).\n\n                 In  Middle  English  short/lax  vowels  were  possible  before  coda  R  (barn,  corn,  burn  all\ncontained short vowels), in CuBE this is no longer possible (for the very simple reason that R\u2011dropping\nwas  introduced  after  Middle  English).  Before  onset  R,  Middle  English  lax  vowels  have  come  to  us\nmostly unchanged (carrot, ferry, burrow, mirror, lorry) because if R was not dropped, there was no\ncompensatory lengthening. This was informally known as the \u2018carrot\u2011rule\u2019. However, recent loans like\n                                                    ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 53", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 79, "end_char_idx": 4992, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c211194-b31f-4d42-9758-2e9dfead50bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c211194-b31f-4d42-9758-2e9dfead50bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d44f07b0-7141-4b24-8ec4-6f7e84660550", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "733b054337b1b18facdacbbd26c9fd7faaca74af4c03337f0e235da2eefed638", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "tiara,  harem,  Sahara  have  introduced  long  \u0251\u02d0  exactly  where  this  was  previously  impossible  (in  the\n\u2018carrot environment\u2019). An opposition between short and long vowels was born. Other sources have\nconspired to introduce the rest of the long vowels before onset R: breaking (and associated changes),\nand the monophthongisation of \u0251w (notorious, Taurus) introduced o\u02d0 before onset R. The \u2018carrot\u2011rule\u2019\nwhich was never really a rule, just a descriptive tool, is thus long dead. We have seen that rules are born,\nthey operate and then die out allowing for new oppositions to develop. Areas once \u2018controlled\u2019 by rules\nare reinterpreted by oppositions arriving from newly borrowed words. The table above shows that in\nCuBE  the  quality  of  vowels  before  r,  or  any  other  consonant  for  that  matter,  is  unpredictable\nphonologically (bad a vs bard \u0251\u02d0, cod \u0254 vs cord o\u02d0, tiara \u0251\u02d0 vs carrot a, etc.) although spelling is of help\n(given its extreme conservatism). Note also how impossible it is to guess the spelling from the phonetic\ninput:  po\u02d0  comes  from  three  different  historical  sources:  *\u0251w  (as  in  paw),  *\u0289w  via  breaking  (and\nassociated changes, as in pour and poor) or *ow via breaking (and associated changes, as in pore).\n\n                  For the hard\u2011core specialists: interestingly, for some words there is still free variation: poor\ncan either have o\u02d0 or \u0289\u0259/\u028a\u0259 (for older speakers), but door can only be o\u02d0 (for both younger and older\nspeakers). Note that in GA door can only have \u0254, but poor can be either \u028a or \u0254. This is because there\nwas a (now invisible) split: some words (like door and course) that originally contained \u0289w split off and\njoined those words that had ow (like boar). This is why they can only have o\u02d0 in CuBE, and \u0254 in GA.\nWords like poor stuck to their historical \u0289w, and have o\u02d0 (or \u028a\u0259 in conservative) SSBE/CuBE,11 and \u028a\nin GA (although poor can also be p\u0254r pointing to a similar split in American, or rather more interestingly\nto a more ancient split in what used to be a common British\u2011American English before one branch split\noff into American).\n\n                  Still for the specialists: note that SSBE shares the wide diphthongs (\u0251j oj aw) with all other\naccents  of  English  (including  GA  and  SSE,  of  course).  The  rest  of  its  diphthongs  originate  in  early\nModern English tense vowels that underwent diphthongisation, see (59) for a summary. We can also\nsay that the diphthongisation rule fed the rule of breaking (it provided additional environments where it\ncould now word). This is a very nice example for where and how accents can begin to differ: in the rules\nthey choose to add to their rule component of phonology.\n11 Note that in any etymological dictionary published before the 1950s, the pronunciation for door and course is given as\n \u0254   (r) and  \u0254   (r)  (which are just like boar b\u0254   (r)), as opposed to poor     . Here, of course, the authors want to show\nwith the length mark on top of \u0254 that it comes from a historically long (tense) vowel, and (r) is only there to show that\nit was historically part the word. In our terms it is an R.\n\n                                                      ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3222, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e9038cc-e224-42d1-9649-e7617ff15fa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e9038cc-e224-42d1-9649-e7617ff15fa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f5c5987-cd10-437e-b132-e36470cf1095", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75bd10f6e5488491a69468a962e524bd68f4b550c05419e342341fa0749fd079", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(59) Diachronic rules in the three major accents of English\n\n                                  Standard         General       Southern\n                                  Scottish         American      Standard\n                                  English                        British\n                                                                 English/CUBE\n    Inheritance of early              YES             YES               YES\n    Modern English\n    wide diphthongs: \u0251j\n    oj aw\n    Broadening                         NO             YES               YES\n    (collective term for first\n    nurse merger and quality\n    change of a and \u0254)\n    Diphthongisation of                NO              NO               YES\n    i e o u > \u026aj \u025bj ow\n    (later \u0259w) uw\n    R-dropping                         NO              NO               YES\n    Compensatory                       NO              NO               YES\n    lengthening\n    Breaking                           NO              NO               YES\n\n\nAs you can see, SSBE is the most innovative accent of English, SSE is the most conservative one.

MVD is responsible for the accentual differences\nbetween Southern and Northern English (referred to as FACE GOAT Diphthonging). We can also see\nthat MVD is historically older than HVD because its results are categorical. This is why \u025bj and \u0259w can\nnever be followed by r in SSBE (care, Mary, more, notorious), as opposed to  \u026aj and uw which can\n(optionally) if the following R is in onset position (serious \u026ajr, lurid uwr). This free variation shows that\nHVD  is  historically  more  recent  than  MVD.  This  is  a  very  fine\u2011grained  analysis,  but  this  is  how  a\nhistorical linguist sets about explaining some of the accentual differences (see 60)).\n\n                                                   ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2286, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efc4fb54-338e-429c-a537-8365357b6bc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "efc4fb54-338e-429c-a537-8365357b6bc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7527353d-edfa-4ad3-bf8e-613742f6c73f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4524641dc21ac19e3765529bc5d54647db1a7d79d6316efe63f7914c40e217e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(60) Diachronic rules in British English (excluding SSE)\n\n                                   Northern British           Southern Standard\n                                   English                    British\n                                                              English/CUBE\n   Inheritance of early                     YES                         YES\n   Modern English wide\n   diphthongs: \u0251j oj aw\n   Broadening (collective                   YES                         YES\n   term for first nurse merger\n   and quality change of a and\n   \u0254)\n   Mid Vowel                                 NO                         YES\n   Diphthongisation of e\n   o > \u025bj ow (later \u0259w)\n   High Vowel                                NO                         YES\n   Diphthongisation of i\n   u > \u026aj uw\n   R-dropping                               YES                         YES\n                                     (in some areas)\n   Compensatory                             YES                         YES\n   lengthening                        (if R dropped)\n   Breaking of the non-                      NO                  YES        Optional\n   wide diphthongs                                            (categori       (for \u026aj\n                                     (as there are no         cal for \u025bj        uw\n                                   diphthongs ending             ow)          before\n                                   in j or w other than                      onset R)\n                                          the wide\n                                     diphthongs, see\n                                           below)\n   Breaking of the wide              Optional before            Optional before\n   diphthongs                             onset R                     onset R\nThe relative \u2018age\u2019 of MVD (as compared to HVD) is signalled by its categorical status.  American\nEnglish broke off before either MVD or HVD started to work.  It thus only has the wide diphthongs,\nwhich are not the result of either MVD or HVD. We can also see that the breaking of the wide diphthongs\nin British English shows similarities with the newest wave of breaking of the historical tense high vowels\n(fiery, sourest, Moira (with the wide diphthongs), serious, tourist (with diphthongs from HVD) have\noptional breaking before onset R). We would still not want to say that these classes of diphthongs are\nequally old historically (the wide diphthongs are found in all accents of English, for example).\n\n                We have discussed some of the major rules of English phonology all the way from Indo\u2011\nEuropean. We have seen a few in\u2011depth studies of how contrast can come into existence, how it can\ndisappear and reappear. The story goes on. You may now pinpoint a few areas where a new contrast\nmay be born in the future. This truly is a never\u2011ending story.\n                                                  ANG-243 \u2013 Attila Starcevic 56", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2931,
