What is true about Lindsey's transcription?
# Schwa is transcribed with a completely unique symbol.

What makes the wl cluster more stable compared to others, at least for some speakers?
# The cluster appears frequently in the English language

# They lose stress on their last syllable
# ! They are stressed on their last syllable similarly to verbs ending in two consonants
# They inherently avoid stress patterns completely
