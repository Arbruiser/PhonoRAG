# ! They behave as consonant-initial words with the glide considered a consonant

== cat 426
Why can't words like "yak" or "wax" be analyzed as beginning with a diphthong in English?
# Because they always take the definite article
# ! Because they behave as consonant-initial words, not taking the indefinite article "an"
# Because they lack historical vowel alternatives

The ordinal suffix [θ] has a vowelful allomorph only after which sound(s)?
# [d]
# [z]
# [ə]
# ! [ij]

== cat 429
Why is there no suffix test for distinguishing vowel- and consonant-final words in English?
# Because all words behave the same way regardless of ending.
# Because suffixes never attach to consonant-final words.
# ! Because the suffix distributions only distinguish between specific sets of consonants, not vowels and consonants.
# Because English words typically end in consonants. 

== cat 430
In the example "twentieth [twentijəθ]", why does the ordinal suffix appear in its vowelful form?
# Because it follows a nasal sound.
# Because it immediately precedes a vowel.
# Because of historical pronunciation rules.
# ! Because it follows the glide sound [ij].

# The addition of a glide before the vowel [o]

== cat 441
Why can R vowels, or long monophthongs, never occur unstressed?
# Because they are always pronounced at the end of words
# Because they are reserved for diphthongs
# ! Because they universally count as heavy and follow tendencies of stressability, making them unsuitable for unstressed positions
# Because they are only used in specific vocabulary words

== cat 442
What does the scale indicate about the stressability of R vowels (VV) in English?
# They are equally unstressable as short vowels
# They can occur unstressed in some dialects
# ! They are the least unstressable vowels and only occur stressed
# They frequently alternate between stressed and unstressed roles

== cat 443
What happens to free vowel+schwa sequences in relation to R vowels?
# They always convert to short vowels
# ! They alternate with R vowels but only in stressed positions
# They occur primarily in unstressed positions
# They are exclusively used in British English

== cat 444
Why can the word "idea" be pronounced as [ajdiː], but "India" cannot be pronounced as [ɪndiː]?
# Because "India" is always pronounced with an initial stress
# Because "idea" is a more frequently used word
# ! Because long vowels like [iː] cannot occur in unstressed syllables
# Because "India" follows different phonological rules

== cat 445
Why can't "jaguar" be pronounced with a final [uː] like "secure"?
# Because "secure" follows an American English rule
# Because "jaguar" ends with a vowel
# ! Because long vowels like [uː] do not occur in unstressed position
# Because "jaguar" has a unique stress pattern

What does the change from [i] to [ij] represent if [ij] is not considered a diphthong?
# A vowel deletion
# A shortening of the vowel
# ! The epenthesis of a consonant, where [j] is added after the short vowel [i]
# A vowel fronting process

== cat 455
Why is the consonant [j] epenthesized word-finally in English according to the paper's interpretation?
# To lengthen the word's ending
# To emphasize the stress on the vowel
# To avoid confusion with similar-sounding words
# ! Because word-final short vowels are dispreferred in English

== cat 456
What linguistic preference leads to the epenthesis of a consonant prevocalically?
# A preference for longer vowels
# The need for lexical variety
# ! The strong dispreference for prevocalic vowels or hiatus
# The demand for emphasis on the prevocalic sound

== cat 457
Why do stressed short vowels not occur either word finally or prevocalically in English?
# ! Because there is a constraint against short vowels in these positions
# Because they are always replaced by long vowels
# Because they are considered ungrammatical
# Because they undergo deletion in modern English

== cat 458
In what context do the unstressed short vowels [i] and [u] occur in the accent described by Jones and Gimson?
# At the beginning of a word
# In all syllable positions
# ! Word finally and prevocalically
# Only in stressed positions

== cat 459
What is the effect of inserting a glide after unstressed short vowels in processes like HAPPY-tensing and VALUE-tensing?
# It creates a new stressed syllable
# It adds weight to the syllable making it heavy
# ! It does not add weight to the final syllable, keeping it light and unstressable
# It shortens the duration of the surrounding vowels

== cat 460
Why do the glides that appear between two vowels, like in [ɪndiə] to [ɪndijə], not contribute to syllable weight?
# Because they are considered diphthongs
# Because they replace the vowel completely
# ! Because they serve as onsets, not adding to moraic weight
# Because they follow a long vowel, making them irrelevant
