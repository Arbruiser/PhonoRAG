What is the reason behind the phonological change of languages?
# To make languages more complex
# To make languages simpler
# ! There is no obvious reason
# To increase vocabulary

== cat 902
Which statement is true?
# Language changes are predictable and easy to understand
# Language changes are random and make languages simpler
# Language changes happen rarely, but can be controlled
# ! Language changes are part of a complex web that is still too complex for us to comprehend

== cat 903
What parallel is drawn between linguistics and sciences like physics or biology?
# Linguistics aims to quantify languages like mathematics
# Linguists often make predictions about language evolution
# ! Linguistics observes and analyses without making value judgments
# Linguistics ranks languages based on complexity and age

== cat 904
When do linguists say that a language is better or worse than another language?
# When a language has more speakers
# When a language is older
# When a language is geographically widespread
# ! Never, such statements are nonsensical in sciences

== cat 905
What is the parallel drawn between the function of human lungs and the movement of tides?
# Both lungs and tides can flow in multiple directions
# Lungs can forcefully empty air just as tides can reverse
# ! Both lungs and tides can only move in one direction at a time
# Lungs are adaptable to rapid changes, just like incoming tides

== cat 906
Where does the structural analysis of the human anatomy of lungs stop?
# At explaining the evolutionary development of lungs
# At predicting future changes in lung function
# ! At describing the function and limitations without explaining their origins
# At comparing lungs with other organ systems

== cat 907
Out of what do evolutionary biologists think human lungs developed?
# A separate respiratory organ evolved later in humans
# The heart's circulatory system
# The skin's ability to absorb oxygen directly
# ! An air bladder that is part of the fish's digestive system

== cat 908
What may explain the reason for why air can only be inhaled and exhaled in one direction?
# It optimizes energy consumption
# It prevents air from returning to the mouth
# It improves the efficiency of oxygen absorption
# ! Air is basically food, and food is normally only transported in one direction

== cat 909
How do fish's air bladders relate to human lungs from a historical perspective?
# Fish bladders evolved independently of lungs
# Fish bladders show no functional similarity to human lungs
# ! Fish air bladders were a part of the digestive system and are ancestors of human lungs
# Fish air bladders are larger capacity storage than human lungs

== cat 910
What evolutionary development is considered to be an innovation in human respiratory function?
# The ability to cough and clear airways
# ! Exhaling air as a separate action from inhalation
# The presence of two distinct lung lobes

What does synchronic linguistics focus on?
# The evolutionary history of languages
# ! The analysis of language units present at a specific point in time
# The influence of languages on human society
# The historical development of writing systems

== cat 913
Why might synchronic linguistics be unaware of its own limitations?
# It considers all historical changes within its analysis
# ! It does not assess the historical development of language units
# It relies heavily on historical data
# It incorporates all possible perspectives on language evolution

== cat 914
What does historical linguistics say about the phoneme ɛː?
# It is a borrowed sound from other languages
# It has always existed in its current form
# ! It is an innovation derived from previous phonemes
# It is unrelated to phonological development

== cat 915
How did the phoneme ɛː develop historically?
# It originated directly from contemporary English sounds
# It was created by blending unrelated phonemes
# ! It evolved through a sequence of changes: aː -> eː -> ɛj -> ɛː
# It was introduced as an entirely new phoneme in modern times

== cat 916
What do verb-final voiced fricatives indicate (house hawz, graze, heave hɪjv, loathe ləwð)?
# They were once nouns that became verbs over time
# They have always been used without any suffixes
# ! There used to be an infinitive suffix after them, such as in housen and grasen
# They evolved from different word roots without any suffixes

== cat 917
What does the historical evolution of the words 'grass' and 'graze' tell us about their vowels? 
# Both 'grass' and 'graze' originally had short vowels
# 'Grass' retains its original vowel length in CuBE

How come we still have nasals before fricatives in English if there was a nasal loss rule?
# Nasal loss rule only applied temporarily during the medieval period 
# Nasals evolved back into certain words
# Some dialects never followed the nasal loss rule
# ! The rule appeared, then disappeared, and stopped working

== cat 933
What is the nasal loss rule?
# The rule that requires nasals to precede fricatives persistently
# ! The rule that states all nasals before fricatives are deleted

How do we know that a word like 'anthem' entered English after the nasal loss rule?
# Old English scribes intentionally omitted words with nasals before fricatives
# 'Anthem' evolved from a different English dialect that did not follow the rule
# ! In Old English texts, 'anthem', 'pansy', and similar words are never found, indicating they entered later
# Historical records show 'anthem' was replaced with alternative words during that period

Why is claiming that Indo-European and Ugro-Finnic are related considered weak?
# They have too few similar syntactic structures
# There is no extensive vocabulary overlap beyond basic elements
# Cultural similarities skew linguistic analysis
# ! They are only compared based on 5 vowels and 9 consonants, which are common in most languages

== cat 938
What does the regularity principle in historical linguistics state?
# ! Language changes can only be regular, there is no other way in which it can be conceived of
# Language changes in language are often arbitrary and unpredictable
# Language changes are regularized by phonologists
# Language changes primarily result from societal influences

== cat 939
What does the uniformitarian principle in historical linguistics state?
# Language changes often introduces completely new phonological rules
# Current language features are novel developments without historical precedent
# Language rules from the present have evolved significantly and bear no resemblance to the past
# ! Whatever we observe nowadays must have existed in the past as well

What is the possible explanation for why we have words like mass and Basque that can have either long or short vowel? Also words like lass, bass ‘perch’, ass ‘donkey’ have a short vowel, while ass ‘backside’ usually has a long vowel, as does moustache.
# These words underwent a new vowel lengthening process after BATH-lengthening
# Vowel length varies due to a general phonetic shift affecting all vowels in English
# These words are influenced by modern pronunciation trends
# ! These words were 'reborrowed' from accents where BATH-lengthening never occurred
