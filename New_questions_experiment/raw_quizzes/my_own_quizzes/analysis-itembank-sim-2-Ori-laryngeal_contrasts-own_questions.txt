# Fortis obstruent following a nasal
# Lenition of the vowel
# Aspiration after a voiceless fricative
# ! A fortis plosive can only be aspirated at the beginning of a word or at the beginning of a stressed syllable

== cat 230
Why is there no aspiration in fíf[t]éen or káf[t]an?
# They end with a vocalic sound
# The preceding vowel is nasalized
# ! Because the plosives are not at the beginning of a word or a stressed syllable
# Due to surrounding voiceless fricatives

== cat 231
What would a native speaker hear in an audio recording of the word "speak" with /s/ chopped off from the beginning of the word?
# Peak
# meak
# feak
# ! Beak

== cat 232
Why would a native speaker hear "beak" instead of "peak" in an audio recording of the word "speak" with /s/ chopped off?
# The vowel is nasalized, altering perception
# The plosive undergoes fortition spontaneously
# ! A word-initial plosive pronounced without aspiration is perceived as a lenis segment
# The stress pattern causes voicing assimilation

== cat 233
Why do we analyze the unaspirated voiceless plosives in s[p]eak, s[k]ool, dis[k]óvery, fíf[t]éen, and káf[t]an phonologically as lenis plosives?
# They occur at the end of syllables
# They follow nasal consonants
# They precede voiced vowels
# ! Because the lack of aspiration leads to their perception as lenis segments

== cat 246
Why do we say that the underlying laryngeal property of the plural/possessive/3rd person singular present tense morpheme -s and the past tense/past participle morpheme -ed are lenis?
# Because they undergo deaspiration
# Because they are followed by nasal sounds
# ! Because they reveal their lenis nature when not affected by a preceding obstruent
