characterized along three dimensions: place of articulation (referring to where the air passing through the vocal tract during the articulation of the consonant is blocked), manner of articulation (describing the degree of the obstruction) and laryngeal property (the quality of the consonant determined by the states of the vocal folds in the larynx)\u2014see the table in (1).2 \r\n \r\n(1) \r\n \r\nAbout half of the world\u2019s languages contrast two series of obstruents differing in their laryngeal properties, e.g., [p] and [b]. This \u201cvoiced\u2013voiceless\u201d contrast can be observed in both Hungarian and English, for example, as indicated by minimal pairs like Hun. /b/\u00e1l \u2018ball\u2019 \u2013 /p/\u00e1l \u2018Paul\u2019 and Eng. /b/all \u2013 /p/aul. Although we can use the terms \u201cvoiced\u201d and \u201cvoiceless\u201d to identify the two types of obstruent in both languages, we must be aware that the phonetic, i.e., physical, realizations of this opposition are different\u2014contrary to what the orthographic conventions suggest. \r\n      As an illustration, you can see in (2) the waveforms of four sound recordings in which a Hungarian and an English native speaker pronounce the abovementioned minimal pairs. Under the waveforms, you can find the spectrograms of the four recordings, in which the darker areas indicate the dominant frequencies of the given sounds (between 0 and 5,000 Hz) and their change over time. Without going into too much detail about it, let us compare the laryngeal properties of these word-initial plosives, separated from the rest of the word by vertical lines in the figures: The /b/ in Hun. b\u00e1l is characterized by actual vocal fold vibration (i.e., voicing), which is indicated by the periodic waveform already in the closure phase of the plosive, and in the spectrogram, by a striated darker area in the low frequency range. If we compare the initial plosive of Hun. P\u00e1l with that of Eng. ball, it is clear that they can be pronounced identically: the closure phase is silent, and vocal fold vibration begins upon release in both cases, i.e., they are voiceless unaspirated. Finally, Eng. Paul also begins with a voiceless plosive; moreover, vocal fold vibration in the next vowel is delayed (by 105 milliseconds), i.e., the plosive is aspirated, which is realized as a [h] sound following the plosive: [ph]. In words like play, where the plosive is followed by a sonorant consonant (more precisely, an approximant/a nonnasal sonorant consonant), aspiration is manifested as the devoicing of the sonorant consonant: [pl\u0325].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2606, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e9fb6a0-fb71-42d9-a8fe-e5d60ee84709": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e9fb6a0-fb71-42d9-a8fe-e5d60ee84709", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-2-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-2-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1012, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2545e7b-87b5-4520-9358-ad1881c51bed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-2-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-2-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1012, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "518e7389fc2aadc1fd60cb13fe141f1868ffb70d474d28679e808ee6d9491805", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(2) \r\n \r\nWe can describe the voicing quality of a plosive using VOT values. \u201cVOT\u201d is an abbreviation for voice onset time, which gives the timing between the release of the plosive and the beginning (= onset) of voicing in the next vowel or sonorant consonant, as shown in the schematized figure in (3). Voiced plosives, in which voicing begins prior to the release of the stops, are characterized by negative VOT. In the case of voiceless unaspirated plosives, where vocal fold vibration begins right around its release, we can talk of zero or short-lag VOT. Finally, voiceless aspirated plosives have positive VOT values (a.k.a. long-lag VOT), which means that voicing is delayed, i.e., lags behind the release of the stop (e.g., in the case of the /p/ of Paul in the above figure, VOT = +105 milliseconds).

In English, the plosives /p, t, k/ have aspirated and unaspirated allophones: [ph, th, kh] and [p, t, k]. These plosives are aspirated in the following environments (defined with reference to syllables): (i) word-initially (e.g., in [ph]\u00e1ralyze, [ph]ol\u00edte and [pl\u0325]\u00e1y) and (ii) at the beginning of a stressed syllable (e.g., in a.[ph]\u00e9ar and a.[pr\u0325 ]\u00f3ve). In other positions, we find the unaspirated alternants (e.g., in ca[p] and ca[p].tain, where the bilabial plosives are syllablefinal, or in h\u00e1.[p]en, where it is not word-initially and is at the beginning of an unstressed syllable). For further details about this allophonic alternation, please read \u201cThe distribution of aspiration\u201d6 and \u201cThe effect of syllables\u201d7 in Phonolec notes. \r\n      Now, let us turn to voicing in English. In the case of sonorant segments (i.e., vowels and sonorant consonants), the unmarked (= phonetically most natural) way of articulating them is with vocal fold vibration (in any language); this type of phonation (or voicing) is called spontaneous voicing. The unmarked case for obstruents, on the other hand, is to be voiceless (in any language), and in English, they can only be passively voiced. That is, if a native speaker of English pronounces an obstruent voiced, vocal fold vibration is not an articulatory target \r\n \r\nbut can only be the effect of the neighboring sounds: if an obstruent is in intersonorant position, the voicing of the sonorants preceding and following it will \u201crun through\u201d it, turning it voiced. So in English, the obstruents /b, d, g; v, \u00f0, z, \u0292; \u02a4/ have the voiced allophones [b, d, g; v, \u00f0, z, \u0292; \u02a4] in intersonorant position (e.g., in a[b]out, li[z]ard, sen[d]ing) and a[bd]omen) and only partially voiced or entirely voiceless allophones elsewhere (e.g., in ball [b\u0325 o\u02d0l~po\u02d0l], bad [bad\u0325 ~bat], rise [r\u0251jz\u0325 ~r\u0251js] and anec[d\u0325 ~t]ote). In Hungarian, voicing in obstruents is the result of active articulatory gestures, so here, we talk of active voicing. For further details on voicing and its distribution in English, please read \u201cTypes of phonetic voicing\u201d8 in Phonolec notes. \r\n      What we have learned so far about the physical realizations of the laryngeal contrast in English can be summarized and illustrated through the following examples: In /p/aul vs. /b/all, the opposition is encoded as the presence vs. absence of aspiration: [ph]aul vs. [b\u0325 ~p]all. The situation is the same /p/ride vs. /b/ride, but here, aspiration is realized as the devoicing of the following sonorant consonant: [pr\u0325 ]ide vs. [b\u0325 ~p]ride. The laryngeal contrast is realized as the presence vs. absence of aspiration in de/k/r\u00e9e vs. de/g/r\u00e9e too, as the /k/ in the former is at the beginning of a stressed syllable; furthermore, since the /g/ in the latter is in intersonorant position, it will be passively voiced, an additional phonetic cue encoding the opposition: de[kr\u0325 ]\u00e9e vs. de[g]r\u00e9e. As for \u00e1/t/om vs. \u00c1/d/am, the /t/ in the former is not aspirated because it occurs word-medially and not at the beginning of a stressed syllable; however, the contrast is maintained via the passive voicing of the intersonorant /d/: \u00e1[t]om vs. \u00c1[d]am. \r\n      What remains to be discussed is the following: as the /t/ in ba/t/ is not aspirated, and the /d/ in ba/d/ does not undergo passive voicing if not followed by a sonorant segment, both of them tend to be pronounced as a voiceless unaspirated [t]. Nevertheless, the laryngeal contrast is not neutralized (= does not disappear) in final position either. Then what phonetic cues are used to encode the opposition? As can be seen in (4), a vowel before \u201cvoiceless\u201d obstruents tends to be shorter than a vowel before their \u201cvoiced\u201d counterparts (e.g., bat [ba\u0306t] vs. bad [ba\u0304d\u0325 ~ba\u0304t] and rice [r\u0251\u0306j\u0306s] vs. rise [r\u0251\u0304j\u0304z\u0325 ~r\u0251\u0304j\u0304s]), which is referred to as prefortis clipping (= prevoiceless shortening). A further phonetic cue that can encode \u201cvoicelessness\u201d in the case of plosives and the affricate /\u02a7/ in this position is preglottalization (a.k.a. glottal reinforcement), i.e., the pronunciation of the glottal stop [\u0294] before these segments (e.g., in bat [ba\u0306\u0294t]).

So while we can find aspirated plosives in words like [ph]eak and [kh]ool, the plosives in s[p]eak and s[k]ool are unaspirated, and so are the ones in dis[k]\u00f3very and f\u00edf[t]\u00e9en (cf. n\u00edne[th]\u00e9en). \r\n      To account for the absence of aspiration in fortis fricative + plosive clusters, we may resort to referring to syllables. Note that we said earlier that a fortis plosive can be aspirated at the beginning of a word or at the beginning of a stressed syllable. This condition is not fulfilled in s[p]eak, s[k]ool and di.s[k]\u00f3.ve.ry, as their plosives are not word- or syllable-initial, so we indeed expect them not to be aspirated. However, there is no aspiration in words like f\u00edf[t]\u00e9en or k\u00e1f[t]an either. The absence of aspiration could fall out of our syllable-based analysis only if we assumed the following syllabifications: f\u00ed.f[t]\u00e9en or k\u00e1.f[t]an, ending up with a syllable-initial /ft/ cluster, which does not occur word-initially. This leads to a peculiar situation since the occurrence of a consonant cluster in syllable-initial position is generally taken to imply the occurrence of that cluster in word-initial position too (therefore, e.g., atlas is to be syllabified as at.las and not as *a.tlas because /tl/ is not a possible word-initial cluster). \r\n      The problem seems to be better solved if we do not let the spelling affect our phonological analysis. If we have an audio recording of the word speak, and we chop off the /s/ from the beginning of the word and ask a native speaker to identify the word they hear, they will say beak and not peak. It should not be too surprising if we know that a word-initial plosive pronounced without aspiration will be perceived as a lenis segment.

The phonetic basis for the assumption of two laryngeal features \r\nAs discussed above, contrary to what the phonemic transcription suggests (together with the spelling), the phonetic (i.e., physical) realizations of plosives in word-initial position are different in the two languages. In Hungarian, it is actual vocal fold vibration, i.e., active voicing, that the contrast lies in: /pa\u02d0l/ is pronounced [pa\u02d0l], and /ba\u02d0l/ is [ba\u02d0l] on the surface too. In English, on the other hand, the lenis plosive of /bo\u02d0l/ is not necessarily voiced on the surface (it tends to be only partially voiced or totally voiceless, so [b\u0325 o\u02d0l~po\u02d0l]), and the fortis plosive of /po\u02d0l/ is not only voiceless but also aspirated ([pho\u02d0l]), which show that the distinctive laryngeal property in word-initial plosives in English is not voicing but aspiration. Therefore, more recently, in nontraditional analyses, obstruents like /b, d, g; v, \u00f0, z, \u0292; \u02a4/ continue to be laryngeally specified in Hungarian-type languages, so they contain the feature [voice]; the laryngeally unspecified series contains obstruents like /p, t, k; f, \u03b8, s, \u0283, h; \u02a7/; however, in English, laryngeal specification is the other way around: /b, d, g; v, \u00f0, z, \u0292; \u02a4/, which are only passively voiced in intersonorant position, form the unspecified series, while /p, t, k; f, \u03b8, s, \u0283, h; \u02a7/, the plosives of which bear the distinctive property aspiration, are taken to be specified for a distinctive feature, [fortis]. \r\nb. The phonological basis for the assumption of two laryngeal features \r\nBesides the phonetic realizations of obstruents, their phonological behaviors also support the idea that the two obstruent series should be represented differently in the two language types. Let us consider the English word /d\u026asgra\u0301f\u026aj\u0259/ and its Hungarian equivalent, /dizgra\u02d0fi\u0254/. What happens in Hungarian is that the voiceless /s/ of the prefix /dis/ undergoes voicing due to the voiced /g/ following it in the next morpheme (we know that the final obstruent of the prefix was underlyingly /dis/ by observing forms like /disl\u025bksi\u0254/, where the following sound is a sonorant consonant or vowel (in this case, /l/), which cannot change the laryngeal identity of the final obstruent of the prefix). This process is called voice assimilation, and as its direction is right-to-left, it is referred to as regressive voice assimilation. As for English, no such assimilation takes place, which is what we expect since voicing is not a distinctive property of lenis obstruents in the language. This follows from the different representation of obstruent series in the two language types, illustrated in (10): In Hungarian, the voiced obstruent /g/ is specified for the distinctive feature [voice], which exhibits backward spreading and turns the preceding voiceless /s/ into a voiced /z/. In English, on the other hand, the lenis /g/ is laryngeally unspecified and therefore cannot affect the fortis /s/ before it, which is the marked obstruent, specified for [fortis].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3223, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b818744b-56fb-4a53-b110-443516365666": {"__data__": {"id_": "b818744b-56fb-4a53-b110-443516365666", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-2-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-2-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1608, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8233f8c8-c1e2-4e32-aed7-9cee7377b0df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-2-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-2-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1608, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "837344f7a997871c4ba19826d8e105b17acbf587dbb3ebcf95d0e431dd3f0010", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(10) \r\n \r\nWhat characterizes aspirating languages and can be analyzed as the spreading of [fortis] in the phonological representation is the case of sonorant devoicing after fortis obstruents. This feature spreading is illustrated in (11). \r\n \r\n(11) \r\n \r\nAnother phenomenon supporting the specification of English obstruents for [fortis] concerns the behavior of the plural/possessive/3rd person singular present tense morpheme -s and the past tense/past participle morpheme -ed\u2014for details, please read \u201cVoicing assimilation\u201d13 in Phonolec notes. We can see that both of these morphemes have three allomorphs, which alternate depending on the obstruents they follow: /z/~/s/~/\u026az/ and /d/~/t/~/\u026ad/ (e.g., /d\u0254gz/, /kats/ and /b\u028cs\u026az/; /stabd/, /st\u0254pt/ and /st\u0251\u02d0t\u026ad/). First, to find out what the underlying laryngeal properties of these morphemes are, we have to find an environment in which the preceding sound is not an obstruent, i.e., an environment in which there is nothing that could affect their laryngeal identity. Forms like /pl\u025bjz/ and /pl\u025bjd/ reveal that these morphemes are underlyingly lenis obstruents, and they may become fortis if preceded by a fortis obstruent. Then, the process /kat/ + /z/ \u2192 /kats/ can be analyzed as the forwards spreading of the feature [fortis] from the /t/ of /kat/ to the plural morpheme \r\n \r\n/z/, turning it into a fortis /s/. This is an instance of laryngeal assimilation, and as its direction is left-to-right, it is progressive laryngeal assimilation.

This can be easily represented if we assume the feature [voice] in this language type. In English, lenis obstruents do not cause laryngeal assimilation. Fortisness, on the other hand, seems to be a phonologically active property: sonorant devoicing after fortis obstruents and the allomorphic alternations of the morphemes -s and -ed can be accounted for if we assume the feature [fortis] in this type of laryngeal system and analyze these phenomena as the forward spreading of [fortis]. \r\nc. A puzzle for representing the laryngeal contrast \r\nHungarian and English seem to be \u201cwell-behaved\u201d voicing and aspirating languages, respectively: which language type they belong to can be read off the phonetic realizations of their obstruents on the one hand, and the phonological behaviors of the obstruents on the other hand. This, in fact, generally applies to other languages too in these categories. However, there exist a few laryngeal systems in which these two criteria for the categorization as a voicing or an aspirating language are not both met.

Therefore, on a phonetic basis, we could argue that both [voice] and [fortis] should be assumed in this system, being a \u201cmixture\u201d of a voicing and an aspirating language. The data in (13b) show the phonological behaviors of obstruents. We can observe that fortisness seems to be the phonologically active property as it is fortis obstruents that trigger assimilation: when a fortis and a lenis obstruent meet in these cases, it is the lenis that undergoes assimilation, turning into its fortis counterpart. As a result, regressive laryngeal assimilation takes place in v\u00e4/g-t/ (deriving v\u00e4[kt]) while in k\u00f6/p-d/e, the laryngeal assimilation is progressive (so we get k\u00f6[pt]e). As for lenisness, it is phonologically inactive. So on a phonological basis, we could argue for encoding the laryngeal contrast only with the feature [fortis].

There always are smart students who soon object: \u201cwhat about lie or like, low or load?\u201d It is not easy to convincingly argue that these words do not contain a word-final or a preconsonantal glide. Perhaps this is because they do.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent description, the vowel system of British English consists of three sets of vowels: short monophthongs, diphthongs, and long monophthongs. Each set contains five, six, or seven members, totalling 18 or 19 vowel types. In this paper my aim is to show that the vowel system of British English is way simpler than that, it consists of no more than six short vowels, i e a o u and \u0259. Anything beyond that, ie long vowels and diphthongs, are simply combinations of one of the six short vowels and a glide, ie a consonant. The analysis revives an unjustly forgotten idea, originally presented by Trager & Bloch (1941).\r\n\r\nWe will first get acquainted with the three sets of vowels Lindsey distinguishes, including a phonotactic justification for these sets (\u00a71). This is followed by an examination of the diphthongs, whether it is indeed the case that the two parts of a diphthong are phonotactically dependent, and whether this would be relevant if it were true (\u00a72). The next section (\u00a73) looks at a curious phonotactic gap in English, namely, three glides, j w h, appear not to occur after a short stressed vowel. We will then look at epenthesis in English, which seems to treat diphthong+liquid sequences as consonant clusters (\u00a74). Potential counterarguments against our proposal are listed in \u00a75. The last but one section (\u00a76) tentatively extends the analysis of diphthongs to long vowels. Conclusions end the paper (\u00a77).\r\n\r\n1 Three sets of vowels\r\nWe begin by introducing the three sets of vowels: short monophthongs (\u00a71.1), diphthongs (\u00a71.2), and long monophthongs (\u00a71.3). As we will see these are not only phonetic categories, but \u2014 more importantly \u2014 phonological, ie phonotactic ones (\u00a71.4). The vowel inventory of British English may be divided by the most general phonotactic patterns.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2186, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32f38a13-5721-405c-bb07-2f7a441eac97": {"__data__": {"id_": "32f38a13-5721-405c-bb07-2f7a441eac97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2130, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e77be627-6b7e-45ac-bd05-a33efadbf987", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2130, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "ed58647f54b493e888a9d1751d22e3a7b4b790825cb790d7e388ca2418430d5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1.1 Short monophthongs\r\nLindsey (2012) distinguishes the six short vowels shown in (1).\r\n\r\n(1)\r\nkit\t\u026a\tfoot\t\u0275\r\ndress\t\u025b\tlot\t\u0254\r\ntrap\ta\tstrut\t\u0259\r\nContrary to the British transcribing tradition, Lindsey does not necessarily use separate symbols for schwa and the vowel of strut. This is justifiable because these two vowels do not contrast: schwa only occurs in unstressed syllables, strut only in stressed syllables. The difference between the vowels of blunderers and blunderbuss may be seen as one of stress: bl\u0259\u0301nd\u0259r\u0259z vs bl\u0259\u0301nd\u0259b\u0259\u0300s. It is exactly because of this difference in their distribution that pedagogically oriented works employ the symbol \u028c for strut, despite the fact that a schwa, especially word finally, can be phonetically equivalent to strut (Jones 1922: \u00a7493, 1960: \u00a7362).\r\n\r\nLindsey\u2019s symbols \u2014 like most other symbol sets used for transcribing British English \u2014 aim to be phonetically precise. The advantages of this practice are clear, but there are certain disadvantages too. The inventory in (1) looks quite alien, in fact the totally unfamiliar symbols do not help the everyday language learner, who form the vast majority of the consumers of these transcriptions. If one has to explain how a symbol like \u0275 ought to be pronounced anyway, one might consider using something simpler. This simplification is also desirable in a theoretically oriented approach, because it lets the analyst posit a system. This is why we are going to use alternative, but very familiar symbols in this paper.

The reader who prefers the symbol [\u00e6] where I use [\u025b] does not need any factual basis to justify his preference\u201d (1935: 98).

The following observations seem to be worth pointing out though.\r\n\r\nIn accent D (New Zealand Acrolect) flapping occurs between two vowels only if the first vowel is short: it occurs neither after diphthongs (eg mitre *m\u00e1j\u027e\u0259), nor after long vowels (eg martyr *m\u00e1\u02d0\u027e\u0259). We have argued that the absence of flapping after diphthongs is explainable if diphthongs are taken to be VC sequences, ie if a t is not in intervocalic position after a diphthongal offglide. If flapping also fails to occur after a long vowel then one may think this is also because such a consonant is not between two vowels, ie a long vowel is also a vowel followed by a consonant.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of this claim is lessened by two considerations: (i) most long vowels of current British English are the result of compensatory lengthening accompanying the loss of an earlier r (eg fort fo\u02d0t) or h (eg fought fo\u02d0t), (ii) these two consonants and the length mark, \u02d0, are in complementary distribution.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do not need to assume that current British English fo\u02d0t is in fact fort or foht, it is enough to postulate that the second part of a long vowel is associated to a consonantal position in the skeleton, assuming an autosegmental representation. Thus the representation of o\u02d0 in English would not be that shown in (20a), but that shown in (20b).\r\n\r\n(20)\r\na.\tV  V\t\tb.\tV  C\r\n\t| /\t\t\t| /\r\n\to\t\t\to\t\r\nIn other words, a long vowel is not a \u201cbranching nucleus\u201d, but a nucleus followed by a \u201ccoda\u201d. This explains the lack of flapping in accent D.\r\n\r\nWe will use the symbol h to represent the vowel associated with a consonantal position. Note that this is the standard practice in the case of prevocalic \u201ch\u201d: the symbol h represents a sound that is phonetically a vowel, but phonologically a consonant in transcriptions like hit, hen, hat, etc. Thus oh is used to transcribe a long vowel which is linked to both a vocalic and a following consonantal position.

Of these unstressed u is always followed by w (eg argue \u00e1hgjuw). Unstressed \u0259 and i are in near complementary distribution with i occurring typically before \u201ccoda\u201d j, \u02a4, \u02a7, and \u014b (eg carry k\u00e1rij, carriage k\u00e1ri\u02a4, ostrich \u00f3stri\u02a7, gosling g\u00f3zli\u014b) and \u0259 in other positions.

As has been shown, using schwa for strut is also a \u201csymbolic\u201d question after all. The case is different with the set of diphthongs Lindsey posits.\r\n\r\nThe vowels of price, mouth, and choice are analysed (ie transcribed) as diphthongs in most transcription systems of English. The American tradition often has monophthongal symbols for face (e) and goat (o), but the British tradition is also rather consistent in seeing these two vowels as diphthongs too. fleece and goose, on the other hand, are consistently taken to be long monophthongs (i\u02d0 and u\u02d0), from Jones (1918)Daniel Jones, An Outline of English Phonetics, Leipzig: Teubner onwards. Interestingly, these vowels were transcribed as ij and uw by Sweet (1900)Henry Sweet, A New English Grammar: Logical and Historical. Oxford: Clarendon Press. at the end of the 19th century, and Jones and his successors do not fail to mention that these two vowels are often pronounced as diphthongs. As we will see below, there is robust distributional evidence that they are diphthongs.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Lindsey represents them so.\r\n\r\n(3)\r\nfleece\t\u026aj\tgoose\t\u0289w\r\nface\t\u025bj\tgoat\t\u0259w\r\nchoice\toj\r\nprice\t\u0251j\tmouth\taw\r\nJust as in the case of short vowels, we could and will use a set of simpler vowel symbols, shown in (4).\r\n\r\n(4)\r\nfleece\tij\tgoose\tuw\r\nface\tej\tgoat\t\u0259w\r\nchoice\toj\r\nprice\taj\tmouth\taw\r\nThe diphthongs of British English may end in one of two types of offglide, i\u032f or u\u032f. Gimson\u2019s (1962) innovation that these should be transcribed by \u026a and \u028a might have been phonetically exact for Received Pronunciation in the middle of the 20th century, but even then it was unnecessarily overprecise. The vowel symbols i and u are not particularly fortunate either for indicating the offglide of a diphthong, because they represent syllabic segments, which diphthongal offglides are not. Nonsyllabicity can be represented by a diacritic, as i\u032f and u\u032f, but using the phonetically equivalent symbols j and w is an even simpler and just as adequate solution.\r\n\r\nReaders familiar with the Jones/Gimson tradition of the transcription of British English may find the set of diphthongs lacking three members, the so called centring diphthongs, the vowels of near, square, and cure. Following Lindsey, we analyse these three vowels as long monophthongs, which we will discuss presently.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2448, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb1315c1-c536-48d6-b5d2-b4ea268492e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb1315c1-c536-48d6-b5d2-b4ea268492e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-3.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5398, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a342a193-9188-43c9-931c-e958803f2e87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-3.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5398, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "1f0cc38176feb11eba5326a57800029d0ab0fcf202e590ca998af8abeab22a83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1.3 Long monophthongs\r\nWe have already seen that Lindsey departs from the traditional classification of the nonshort vowels: fleece and goose are analysed as diphthongs, near, square, and cure as long monophthongs. square is clearly a monophthong, and began to be transcribed as such by Upton (1995). Its status is rather similar to that of force, for which Jones records a diphthongal \u0254\u0259 pronunciation almost a century ago, but he deems it obsolete already in those days. The reason force became established as a monophthong is that separate symbols for it and north could not be maintained once the two vowels ceased to contrast. The homophonous pair mourning and morning cannot be transcribed differently, with \u0254\u0259 and \u0254\u02d0. On the other hand, nothing forced the introduction of the monophthongal symbol for square, since this vowel did not merge with any other vowel of the British inventory, so the \u201cphonetically precise\u201d symbol \u025b\u02d0 turned up only at the end of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nBoth near and cure are more variable than square, but in different ways. near is usually monophthongal before a consonant, especially before r: eg hero h\u026a\u02d0r\u0259w, nearer n\u026a\u02d0r\u0259, pierce p\u026a\u02d0s, here you are h\u026a\u02d0 juw \u0251\u02d0. Utterance finally this vowel may split up into two syllables, the diphthong ij followed by schwa: you're here jo\u02d0 hij\u0259. This kind of variation is found in other vowels too: eg fire faj\u0259 vs fire brigade fa\u02d0 br\u0259gejd, sour saw\u0259 vs sour sauce sa\u02d0 so\u02d0s.\r\n\r\ncure, on the other hand, has split into two different vowels for some speakers. After palatal consonants these speakers pronounce either the long version of foot (eg cure kj\u0275\u02d0, jury \u02a4\u0275\u02d0rij, sure \u0283\u0275\u02d0), or they merge this vowel with nurse (kj\u0259\u02d0, \u02a4\u0259\u02d0rij, \u0283\u0259\u02d0). Elsewhere cure has merged with force: eg poor po\u02d0, tour to\u02d0, gourmand go\u02d0m\u0259nd. Let us call this phenomenon the Poor\u2013Cure Split. Speakers who do not have the Poor\u2013Cure Split have cure and force merged in all environments: eg cure kjo\u02d0, jury \u02a4o\u02d0rij, sure \u0283o\u02d0, poor po\u02d0.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the long monophthongs have been analysed as such in the British tradition throughout the 20th century. (5) gives Lindsey\u2019s list of long monophthongs.\r\n\r\n(5)\r\nnear\t\u026a\u02d0\t(cure\t\u0275\u02d0)\r\nsquare\t\u025b\u02d0\tforce/north/thought/cure\to\u02d0\r\nstart/bath/palm\t\u0251\u02d0\tnurse(/cure)\t\u0259\u02d0\r\nJust as in the case of short vowels and diphthongs, the transcription of long monophthongs could also be simplified by using mostly standard orthographical symbols, as shown in (6).\r\n\r\n(6)\r\nnear\ti\u02d0\t(cure\tu\u02d0)\r\nsquare\te\u02d0\tforce/north/thought/cure\to\u02d0\r\nstart/bath/palm\ta\u02d0\tnurse(/cure)\t\u0259\u02d0\r\nSome speakers with the Poor-Cure Split have six long monophthongs, others with the split (who merge cure and nurse after palatals) and those without the split (who merge cure and force unconditionally) have only five.\r\n\r\nThe chart in (7) summarizes the long vowels of the three accents, comparing them to \u201cclassical RP\u201d, the system of Jones. It can be seen that \u201csplit\u201d accents are those that have distinct vowels in cure and poor. The last two accents, split 2 and no split, both have the same five long vowels, but their lexical incidence differs in cure.\r\n\r\n(7)\r\n\t\tnear\tsquare\tstart\tnurse\tcure\tpoor\tforce\r\n\u201cRP\u201d\t\ti\u0259\t\u025b\u0259\t\u0251\u02d0\t\u0259\u02d0\tu\u0259\tu\u0259\t\u0254\u02d0\r\nsplit 1\t\ti\u02d0\te\u02d0\ta\u02d0\t\u0259\u02d0\tu\u02d0\to\u02d0\to\u02d0\r\nsplit 2\t\ti\u02d0\te\u02d0\ta\u02d0\t\u0259\u02d0\t\u0259\u02d0\to\u02d0\to\u02d0\r\nno split\ti\u02d0\te\u02d0\ta\u02d0\t\u0259\u02d0\to\u02d0\to\u02d0\to\u02d0\r\n1.4 Vowel phonotactics\r\nIt has already been hinted at that the main reason for analysing diphthongs as diphthongs and long monophthongs as long monophthongs is not because they are pronounced so, but because they form natural classes with respect to the environments they occur in. We will now look at these environments.\r\n\r\nThe broadest categories of speech sounds are consonant and vowel. To this we may add a third, morphological category, the end of the word, ie a free morpheme. The three kinds of vowel mentioned above behave differently in whether they may occur before a consonant, before another vowel, or at the end of a word.

Stressed \u201cschwa\u201d, ie strut, is like the other short vowels, it cannot occur word finally.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, unstressed schwa patterns with long monophthongs: these vowels may occur at the end of a word, but not before another vowel (cf the a similar pattern in Dutch, noted by Trommelen 1989, cited by Cyran 2010: 273). Many speakers even insert a consonant, r, after a word-final long monophthong or a schwa if the next word or suffix begins with a vowel: eg draw out dro\u02d0r awt, drawing dro\u02d0ri\u014b.\r\n\r\nIt is only the diphthongs that occur unconstrained in these three types of environment, ie we can find diphthongs before a consonant, before a vowel, or at the end of a word. There are some constraints on diphthongs before consonant clusters, but while two of the long monophthongs, i\u02d0 and e\u02d0,\u00bb never occur before a cluster, all of the diphthongs do. Also u\u02d0 for those speakers who have it.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to examining the nonshort vowels of British English, to see if they really constitute complex vowels that are part of the vowel inventory.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 5230, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa4c96d-3548-4654-afe1-393760d63227": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfa4c96d-3548-4654-afe1-393760d63227", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-4.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-4.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5674, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df6367c2-2a08-4608-b00e-c3e6ce791f49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-4.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-4.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5674, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "b9fe4491abc53b0f4112f1518ffccdc44fa73d3aa1e04e3c83af21eed769f2f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2 Parts of a diphthong\r\nOne argument for the integrity of the sequence of a vowel followed by a glide is that not any glide may follow any vowel, ie the two parts of a diphthong are phonotactically related. This may easily be verified if we take another look at the diphthongs of English, shown in (9).\r\n\r\n(9)\r\n\r\n\tj\t\tw\r\ni\tij fleece\t\r\ne\tej face\t\r\na\taj price\taw mouth\r\no\toj choice\t\r\nu\t\t\tuw goose\r\n\u0259\t\t\t\u0259w goat\r\nThe distribution of the two glides after the short vowels is almost complementary, there is one exception: both glides occur with a as their first element. Phonetically these two low vowels are different, the one in aj is more back (hence Lindsey\u2019s symbol \u0251j), the other one in aw is more front. We believe that such detail need not be indicated in phonological transcription, which is not concerned with the precise phonetic content of its symbols.\u00bb\r\nNote, for example, that the symbol r is widely used for sounds that are very different from an alveolar trill.\r\n\r\nHowever, very similar charts can be produced about consonants, yet they are not used for arguing for the integrity of these clusters. Consider the facts in (10). (The clusters tj and dj have almost become obsolete in British English, yielding \u02a7 and \u02a4, respectively: tube \u02a7uwb, during \u02a4o\u02d0ri\u014b, cf Cruttenden 2014: 83.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(10)\r\n\tj\t\tw\r\np\tpj pure\t\r\nb\tbj beauty\t\r\nf\tfj few\t\r\nt\t\t\ttw twin\r\nd\t\t\tdw dwell\r\n\u03b8\t\t\t\u03b8w thwack\r\nOne could argue that these consonants also exist independently of each other in English, so that we have contrasting triplets like pure pjo\u02d0, poor po\u02d0, and your jo\u02d0 or twin, tin, and win. But the same is true of the two parts of a diphthong: meet mijt vs mint, mate mejt vs melt. So why should diphthongs be treated differently from consonant clusters?\r\n\r\nIn addition, recent changes in British English are leading towards a system where the gaps of the diphthong space are gradually filled in. A very important development in this direction is the vocalization of nonprevocalic l. As a result of this change, the glide w may occur after any vowel, as (11) shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n(11)\r\n\r\n\tj\t\t\tw\r\ni\tij fleece\t\tiw bill\r\ne\tej face\t\t\tew bell\r\na\taj price\t\taw mouth\r\no\toj choice\t\tow ball\r\nu\t\t\t\tuw goose\r\n\u0259\t\t\t\t\u0259w goat\r\nIn such a system either one must recognize three further \u201cdiphthongs\u201d, iw ew ow, or else mouth cannot be seen as a diphthong. An even more recent development in British English is the fronting of the glides of goose and goat. This change results in these lexical sets having vowel+glide sequences that could be transcribed as uj and \u0259j, respectively (Altendorf & Watt 2004: 191). But, as a result of L vocalization, we are not left without uw and \u0259w as the examples in (12) show.\r\n\r\n\r\n(12)\r\n\tj\t\t\tw\r\ni\tij fleece\t\tiw bill\r\ne\tej face\t\t\tew bell\r\na\taj price\t\taw mouth\r\no\toj choice\t\tow ball\r\nu\tuj goose\t\tuw bull\r\n\u0259\t\u0259j goat\t\t\t\u0259w dull\r\nCrucially, however, we do not need a fully saturated vowel+glide chart, like the one in (12), to argue for treating the two parts of a diphthong as separate entities. That is, vowel+glide sequences are not necessarily diphthongs even in accents that only have those listed in (9).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Gaps in glide distribution?\r\nIf we examine the distribution of nonnasal sonorants in English, ie l r j w h, we see that they typically occur in prevocalic environments. In fact, in L vocalizing accents, all these consonants occur exclusively prevocalically. They are, however largely insensitive to the environment that precedes them. This is shown in (13). Note that h occurs before the consonant j (and for some before w too), but only if a stressed vowel follows (eg huge hj\u00faw\u02a4, what (h)w\u00f3t). On the other hand, l (and for some r) may also be followed by j, but this time only if an unstressed vowel follows (eg value v\u00e1ljuw, virulent v\u00edr(j)\u0259l\u0259nt).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(13)\r\n\r\n\tl\tr\tj\tw\th\r\n#__V\tlay\tray\tyet\twit\thit\r\nC__V\tclay\tgrey\tcute\tquit\t?\r\nV__V\tallay\tarray\tbeyond\taway\tahead\r\n\r\nIf we look at the vowels these consonants occur after in more detail, we find a further difference between them. The distibutions diverge after stressed and after unstressed vowels. This is shown in (14).\r\n\r\n(14)\r\n\tl\tr\tj\tw\th\r\nV__V\u0301\tall\u00e1y\tarr\u00e1y\tbey\u00f3nd\taw\u00e1y\tah\u00e9ad\r\nV\u0301__V\t\u00e1lly\t\u00e1rrow\t\t(D\u00e9wi)\t(Dr\u00f3gheda)\r\n\r\nWe see that while l and r freely occur before unstressed vowels as well as stressed ones, the occurrence of j, w, and h is limited. All three marginally occur before an unstressed vowel, but with various restrictions: typically the preceding vowel must be long or unstressed (eg Darwin d\u00e1\u02d0win, Malawi m\u0259l\u00e1\u02d0wij, narwhal n\u00e1\u02d0w\u0259l, Ottawa \u00f3t\u0259w\u0259; yahoo j\u00e1\u02d0huw, Monahan m\u00f3n\u0259h\u0259n; sawyer s\u00f3\u02d0j\u0259). The vowel before these three consonants, however, cannot be short and stressed (cf Polg\u00e1rdi 2015 ), we have found only some Celtic names that go against this restriction: Dewi d\u00e9wij, Drogheda dr\u00f3h\u0259d\u0259, Mulcahy m\u0259lk\u00e1hij.\r\n\r\nInstead of asking why j, w, and h may not occur after a short vowel, let us ask \u2014 like our smart students \u2014 if this is really the case. We contend that this impression is a result of analysing vowel+glide sequences as diphthongs. In fact, if we take them to be what they are, vowel+glide sequences, then the gap in the distribution of glides disappears. In (15) we list a small subset of the many words that contain a short vowel followed by j or w.\r\n\r\n(15)\r\nneon n\u00edjon, crayon kr\u00e9j\u0259n, lion l\u00e1j\u0259n, royal r\u00f3j\u0259l, vowel v\u00e1w\u0259l, Noah n\u0259\u0301w\u0259, fuel fj\u00faw\u0259l\r\nIn fact, if we analyse diphthongs in this way, glides will not be impossible word finally or preconsonantally any more. Words like eye aj or toe t\u0259w now end in a glide, while others like ice ajs or toad t\u0259wd contain preconsonantal glides.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 5580, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5dc0c05-29e8-4be0-b047-3ee6787c80c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5dc0c05-29e8-4be0-b047-3ee6787c80c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-5.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-5.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3114, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0248e713-4b7f-4573-aed7-640457132261", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-5.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-5.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3114, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "f1210ac792ed01abc70df8c84a5c73599ee5de3a640307988323d3b7e926d5d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4 Epenthesis\r\nEnglish has consonant clusters word finally (eg lamp, sink, list, risk, lift, pact). However, not any combination of two consonants is possible at the end of a word. One limiting factor is sonority: the second member of a word-final consonant cluster is typically less sonorous than the first. Many words that entered English with a cluster that conflicted with this requirement were amended by epenthesizing \u0259 between the two consonants: eg French m\u00e8tre m\u025btr > mijt\u0259r, Old French temple > temp\u0259l, Late Latin prisma > priz\u0259m. In other cases we find two word-final consonants that are not \u201cdifferent enough\u201d to form a cluster: eg matches ma\u02a7+z > ma\u02a7\u0259z or fitted fit+d > fit\u0259d. These are again broken up by epenthesis.\r\n\r\nWhile the clusters mentioned so far are invariably broken up by speakers of English, others are variable in this respect: eg elm elm or el\u0259m, farm fa\u0279m or fa\u0279\u0259m, earn \u0259\u02d0\u0279n or \u0259\u02d0\u0279\u0259n, girl g\u0259\u02d0\u0279l or g\u0259\u02d0\u0279\u0259l (Trawick-Smith 2015, also Wells 1982: 435). Standard versions of the sonority hierarchy order these consonants as m = n < l < r (cf Szigetv\u00e1ri 2008 : 95f and references there), so these clusters look acceptable falling sonority clusters. Nevertheless, it seems that the sonority distance between these sounds is not enough for some speakers to maintain the clusters (cf Steriade 1982), which again is cured by epenthesis.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable in this light that many speakers of English epenthesize \u0259 between a diphthong and a following r or l, too. Some examples are given in (16).\r\n\r\n(16) \r\nheed hijd vs heel hij\u0259l, here hij\u0259(r)/hi\u02d0/h\u026ar\r\nfade fejd vs fail fej\u0259l\r\nfine fajn vs file faj\u0259l, fire faj\u0259(r)/fa\u02d0\r\ncoin kojn vs coil koj\u0259l, coir koj\u0259(r)\r\ndown dawn, foul fawl vs flour flaw\u0259(r)/fla\u02d0\r\nfoam f\u0259wm, foal f\u0259wl/fowl\r\nmoon muwn, fool fuwl vs moor muw\u0259(r)/mo\u02d0/m\u028ar\r\nThe sequences of the narrow diphthongs ej and ow/\u0259w plus \u0259 have monophthongized earlier (ej\u0259 > e\u02d0, as in fair, and ow\u0259 > o\u02d0, as in more), hence we find no bisyllabic examples for them with r in (16b) and (16f). (Such monophthongization is also possible, but not obligatory for most of the other diphthongs, as shown by the variant pronunciations.) The r itself at the end of these words is variably present or absent in different varieties of English. We see that epenthesis always applies before r, but only after a subset of the diphthongs before l. Notably, it is only after diphthongs with a front offglide that we have epenthesis before l. This distribution makes sense if we analyse diphthongs as vowel+consonant sequences. Thus it is the consonant clusters jl, as well as jr and wr that induce epenthesis. We could argue that wl is more stable a cluster because its members are homorganic \u2014 at least for speakers who have a velarized l. In any case, it is not easy to see what would force epenthesis between a vowel and a consonant, if diphthongs were seen as vowels. If, however, they are analysed as a vowel and a consonant as here, then epenthesis is expected because a glide and a following liquid are very close to each other in sonority.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3053, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11227b6e-f8c5-4623-bd0c-ad32e1399726": {"__data__": {"id_": "11227b6e-f8c5-4623-bd0c-ad32e1399726", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-6.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-6.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1713, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b54c75d-5d7d-4963-9575-3339124a0379", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-6.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-6.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1713, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "1cb7c3fdd326151709f75ac4cc850ab037adb36431fe771f65ff254df346953f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "5 Counterarguments\r\nIf diphthongs are indeed sequences of a short vowel and a glide (a consonant), then why is there an almost uniform opinion in the literature on English phonology that these sequences are diphthongs? There must be some reason other than the phonotactic interdependence of the vowel and the glide, which, as we have seen, is not necessarily relevant on the one hand, and is disappearing on the other. We will now take a brief look at some further potential reasons.\r\n\r\n5.1 History and spelling\r\nMiddle English had seven long vowels, i\u02d0 e\u02d0 \u025b\u02d0 a\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0 o\u02d0 u\u02d0. The quality of these vowels changed considerably in the Great Vowel Shift, and they all became diphthongs: aj ij ij/ej ej \u0259w uw aw, respectively. Diphthongs of Middle English have either merged with these \u201cnew\u201d diphthongs (eg the ow of grow with the \u0254\u02d0 > ow/\u0259w of go), or monophthongized (eg the aw > o\u02d0 of thaw), or remained as is (eg the oj of choice).\r\n\r\nEnglish spelling still reflects Middle English in many respects, so diphthongs are often spelled by a single vowel letter, in fact, only two diphthongs, oj and aw, cannot be spelled in this way. Many Middle English long\u2013short alternations developed into a diphthong\u2013short vowel alternation in current English: eg keep kijp\u2013kept, grave grejv\u2013gravity grav\u0259tij, mime majm\u2013mimic mimik, south saw\u03b8\u2013southern s\u0259\u00f0\u0259n, holy h\u0259wlij\u2013holiday holidej, fool fuwl\u2013folly folij, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause of this historical burden there is a strong tradition of calling diphthongs \u201clong vowels\u201d: ie ej as \u201clong A\u201d, ij as \u201clong E\u201d, etc. With this background the reluctance of analysing these \u201cvowels\u201d as vowel+consonant sequences is hardly surprising.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1655, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db0f2bf2-c5b3-43cb-bd0b-0a7e563d4320": {"__data__": {"id_": "db0f2bf2-c5b3-43cb-bd0b-0a7e563d4320", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2876, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7f67f46-5240-4ad2-95b8-04b2dd0b478e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2876, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "230a0918877462cb7e227dbfda44145aa2211b45b8d5734e9f4f2b344496a1b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "5.2 Stress patterns\r\nThere is some reason to believe that the location of word stress in English can be calculated from segmental patterns.\r\n\r\nAnalysing diphthongs as VC (as opposed to VV) sequences influences stress-calculating algorithms in three cases. Firstly, in verbs final VV and VC is distinguished: the former is stressed, the latter is not (eg agree \u0259gr\u00edj vs habit h\u00e1bit. In fact, this distinction was not clear even in the time of its statement: word-final \u201clong U\u201d had to be listed as an exception (as in argue \u00e1\u02d0gjuw, continue k\u0259nt\u00ednjuw). In current English ij and \u0259w also occur in final position in verbs without \u201cattracting\u201d stress (eg carry k\u00e1rij, follow f\u00f3l\u0259w). Furthermore, there are VC-final verbs whose final syllable is stressed (eg omit \u0259m\u00edt, rebel r\u0259b\u00e9l). Verbs that end in a diphthong followed by a consonant are stressed on their last syllable exactly like verbs that end in two consonants, so it makes no difference in this case if diphthongs are analysed as VC: both ferment f\u0259m\u00e9nt and cremate kr\u0259m\u00e9jt are stressed on their ult.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Chomsky & Halle (1968: 72, 78) claim that a \u201clong vowel\u201d in the last syllable of a word is always stressed. Thus, although polysyllabic nouns are not usually stressed on their ult \u2014 which is extrametrical, says Hayes (1982) \u2014, they are when this syllable contains a long vowel: cf arcade a\u02d0k\u00e9jd vs stipend st\u00e1jpend. Burzio shows that \u201cthere is [\u2026] no reason to suppose that long vowels in final syllables are always stressed\u201d (1994: 48\u201352). The \u201cdiphthong\u201d in arcade is stressed like the VCC sequence in defence d\u0259f\u00e9ns and the VCC sequence in stipend is unstressed like the \u201cdiphthong\u201d (or, as claimed here, VCC sequence) in decade d\u00e9kejd.\r\n\r\nThirdly, nouns and adjectives seem to distinguish VV$ and V$C in their penult: a \u201cdiphthong\u201d is tautosyllabic, hence it attracts stress, but a vowel followed by a heterosyllabic consonant does not. Since both parts of a diphthong belong to the penult, but a single consonant belongs to the last syllable here, the penult is light in the latter case: cf European j\u00f3\u02d0r\u0259p\u00edj\u0259n vs regimen r\u00e9\u02a4im\u0259n. If the ij in European were a VC sequence, one might argue, then onset maximization would syllabify the j into the last syllable, therefore the CV structure of the last two syllables of these two words would be the same (ij\u0259n and im\u0259n). Note, however, that there are plenty of words that have the same sequence in their last two syllables, but are stressed on their antepenult (eg Cyclopean sajkl\u0259\u0301wpij\u0259n, scorpion sk\u00f3\u02d0pij\u0259n), what\u2019s more other words that have the latter sequence are stressed on their penult (eg persimmon p\u0259s\u00edm\u0259n).\r\n\r\nWe may conclude that \u201cstress rules\u201d cannot be used convincingly to argue for analysing diphthongs either as \u201clong vowels\u201d or as VC sequences.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2784, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "668a7e73-216c-411e-8f9f-675b978e541b": {"__data__": {"id_": "668a7e73-216c-411e-8f9f-675b978e541b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-8.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2011, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "330f94ef-0e3d-48ad-a242-2992470ea11b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-3-8.txt", "file_name": "settext-3-8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2011, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "70359b1381fd3f105f9949249a6497e2e948e105db9d267607131a3bc33a58c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "5.3 \u201cIntervocalic\u201d lenition\r\nIn many accents of English consonants do not retain all their properties in intervocalic position. T-flapping is a well-known example of this phenomenon. Within morphemes in many flapping accents of English t-flapping is restricted to the nonpretonic environment (eg matter m\u00e1\u027e\u0259). However, the same kind of lenition also occurs after diphthongs (eg mitre m\u00e1j\u027e\u0259), which is a problem if diphthongs are to be seen as vowel+consonant sequences, because in this case, the consonant undergoing lenition is not intervocalic.\r\n\r\nIt is not the case, however, that this type of lenition categorically occurs after vowels, but not after consonants.

What is crucial for us is the difference between accents C and D in (17). This contrast is manifested by New Zealand English Basilect (C) and Acrolect (D) flapping (Bye & de Lacy 2008: 195ff).\r\n\r\nWe contend that in accent D flapping occurs exclusively in intervocalic position, whereas in accents A, B, and C it may also occur after consonants: the more sonorous the consonant before the flapping site is, the more likely flapping is to occur. It is accent D that categorizes diphthongal offglides \u2014 and the second half of long vowels too(!) \u2014 together with (other) consonants.

Most of these descriptions include a group of vowels that are analysed as diphthongs. This group comprises several sets that are variably seen as diphthongs or as monophthongs.

NEAR, SQUARE, FORCE, CURE\r\nPractically all accounts of English take the vowels in (1a) to be diphthongs. Accounts of British English count the vowels in (1b) to be diphthongs too, those of American English are varied (diphthongs in Chomsky & Halle 1968; monophthongs in Kenyon & Knott 1953 or Giegerich 1992). Sweet (1900) transcribes FLEECE and GOOSE as [flijs] and [guws], it is only Jones (1917) who (wrongly, as I will argue) alters the British tradition, and introduces the currently prevalent monophthongal symbols [i\u02d0] and [u\u02d0] for the vowels in (1c). American accounts again vary, the typical case is to lump the vowels in (1b) and (1c) together, either as diphthongs ([ey], [ow]; [iy], [uw]) or as (tense) monophthongs ([e], [o]; [i], [u], respectively). The vowels of the last group, (1d), are vowel\u00fe[r] sequences in rhotic American English, occasionally centring diphthongs. In British English they were diphthongs at the beginning of the last century, but have all gradually monophthongized. This is reflected in the transcription of FORCE by Jones (1917): [f\u0254\u02d0s] (vs. Sweet\u2019s [f\u0254\u0259s]); CURE and SQUARE by Upton (1995): [kj\u0254\u02d0] (vs. Gimson\u2019s [kj\u028a\u0259], 1962; already mentioned in Jones 1917) and [skw\u025b\u02d0] (vs. Gimson\u2019s [skwe\u0259]), and also NEAR by Lindsey (2012a, 2019): [n\u026a\u02d0] (vs. Upton\u2019s [n\u026a\u0259]). I take all the vowels of (1d) to be long monophthongs, and all the vowels of (1a\u2013c) to be \u201cdiphthongs\u201d, or more precisely, not single monophthongal vowels. This categorization is based on the distribution of these vowels, to which we turn presently.\r\n1. THE VOWEL INVENTORY OF BRITISH ENGLISH (BRE)\r\nThe vowel inventory of English is often split into tense and lax vowels. This distinction reflects that some vowels can be traced back to Middle English long vowels and diphthongs (these are tense), others to Middle English short vowels (these are lax). However, in nonrhotic British English, where compensatory lengthening ensuing the loss of historical [r] and the later loss of\r\n[\u0259] produced long vowels merging these two categories (e.g., far [far] > [fa\u02d0]; fire [fajr] > [faj\u0259r] > [faj\u0259] > [fa\u0259] > [fa\u02d0]), the tense vs. lax split is partly merged, and so it is not meaningful any more.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2642, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7efeb715-0d00-4dfd-b920-27e7064d816b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7efeb715-0d00-4dfd-b920-27e7064d816b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1801, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a73ffc4-9d14-476b-978b-a9a055b912cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1801, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "29cb3efffae23c37b4f172f20b7f04ddb29cc7852955d4a09c5a274dbfd1a1d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Instead, we will classify vowels by the environments in which they occur.

CONCLUSIONS\r\nI argue that there are several reasons to analyse unstressed FLEECE, GOAT, and GOOSE as KIT, STRUT, and FOOT, respectively, followed by the consonant [j] in the first case, and the consonant [w] in the latter two. On the other hand, there is no reason to take these sequences to be diphthongs: we have seen that suffixes or clitics do not provide evidence for such an analysis. In fact, if they are taken to be diphthongs, then we encounter a rather unexpected vowel strengthening in unstressed position (known as HAPPY-tensing). In Szigetvari (2016), I look at English vowels in stressed position too and come to the same result. In the present paper, I survey evidence provided by these vowels in unstressed position. The reasons for analysing unstressed [ij], [\u0259w], and [uw] as VC, not as VV are the following:\r\n1. the first parts of [ij], [\u0259w], and [uw] are identical to the three unstressable short vowels, [i], [\u0259], and [u];\r\n2. the change of word-final and prevocalic [i] into [ij] in unstressed position makes sense only if [ij] is VC;\r\n3. the optional or obligatory loss of [w] from unstressed [\u0259w] and [uw] in preconsonantal position makes sense if they are VC;\r\n4. the stability of [i] and [u] before the homorganic glides [j] and [w] is parallelled by thestability of the same unstressed vowels before a homorganic consonant.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1355, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df6ebb12-a96e-450d-a651-a50f1fdde0af": {"__data__": {"id_": "df6ebb12-a96e-450d-a651-a50f1fdde0af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-2.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1867, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57bd7819-3b07-404d-8c30-b1176915f5e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-2.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1867, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "4bc52ceb68ed434f8bbbf24cfd584fe7521efc3c9f93af7a0e2e7888e382ab53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(3) The vowels of BrE\r\na. checked vowels: KIT [i], DRESS [e], TRAP [a], STRUT [\u0259], LOT [o], FOOT [u]\r\nb.

DIPHTHONG OR VC/CV?\r\nA diphthong is the combination of a vowel and an adjacent glide (or, perhaps schwa) into what is considered as one unit. What kind of unit this is is not clear: it is usually not a segment in the autosegmental sense, since it consists of two skeletal slots with melody associated to each. The literature also mentions so-called light (monomoraic) diphthongs, which are monosegmental (linked to a single skeletal slot, Kaye 1989, 128), but their status is even less clear. Whether a vowel\u00feglide or glide\u00fevowel sequence is a diphthong is a question that phonetics cannot answer, this is a matter of phonological analysis, and accordingly this is a language-specific issue. It may well happen that a vowel\u00feglide or glide\u00fevowel sequence is a diphthong in some variety of a language, but not in another variety.\r\n   It can even be argued that the status of a glide\u00fevowel sequence may differ from word to word. With respect to article selection, the French word [jatys] \u2018hiatus\u2019, for example, behaves as a vowelinitial word: it selects the vowelless form of the singular definite article, [ljatys], which is typical of words that begin with a vowel. The beginning of the word [jau\u0281t] \u2018yoghurt\u2019 is rather similar, yet it selects the vowelful form of the singular definite article, like consonant-initial words do: [l\u0259jau\u0281t]. Digging a bit deeper, we find some facts that may make us wary. On the one hand, [jatys] has an alternative form [iatys], which begins with a \u201creal\u201d vowel, but [jau\u0281t] does not have such an alternative form. Yet [wat] \u2018watt\u2019 selects the vowelful singular definite article [l\u0259wat], while [wat] \u2018cotton\u2019 may also select the vowelless allomorph, [lwat], although the latter word has no vowel-initial variant, p[uat]. On the other hand, there exist numerous French words that begin with a \u201creal\u201d vowel, and yet select the preconsonantal, vowelful variant of the singular definite article: for example, [\u025bn] \u2018hatred\u2019, [la\u025bn]. Many (though not all) of these words have a [h]-initial etymon: [\u025bn], for example, is a descendant of the same Proto-Germanic word as English hate, which did indeed begin with a consonant.\r\n   English is less variable in this respect. Vowel-initial words select the consonantful variant of the indefinite article (an apple), consonant-initial words select the consonantless variant (a pear). This distribution holds even in words that are variable: we have a hen for speakers who pronounce hen as [hen], but an hen for those who pronounce it as [en].\r\n   With its phonetically stable article selection, English provides us with a criterion for analysing \u201cdiphthongs\u201d that begin with the glide. Words like yak or wax cannot begin with a diphthong, because they do not behave like vowel-initial words: pan yak, pan wax figure. In fact, no glide\u00fevowel sequence can be analysed as a diphthong in English: even words that were historically vowel initial behave as (5 are) consonant initial today when they begin with a glide (e.g., a ewe, a eulogy, a unit, a Uyghur). That is, the article test neatly distinguishes consonantand vowel-initial words in English, and uniformly categorizes glides with consonants and, consequently, glide\u00fevowel sequences as clusters, not diphthongs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3238, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca58e21c-7687-4f93-ba82-19df3b74ecd3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca58e21c-7687-4f93-ba82-19df3b74ecd3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-4.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-4.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3256, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24442c2f-9385-4937-a295-fc9513ac02ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-4.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-4.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3256, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "b83ec664e7eddc3b8c32165080d5a41c0ba193fc6a77f332bd90cc2e60be1591", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The situation is less obvious word finally. The distributions of the allomorphs of the past tense ([d] \u223c [id]) and the nominal plural suffix ([z] \u223c [iz]) do not distinguish between vowels and consonants, but between some set of consonants (alveolar plosives and sibilants, respectively) and the set comprising all other consonants and vowels. The ordinal suffix [q] has a vowelful allomorph only after [ij] (as in twentieth [twentij\u0259q]), but not after any other segment, be it a vowel (as in fourth [fo:q]) or any consonant (as in tenth [tenq], eighth [ejtq]) or consonant cluster (as in thousandth [qawz\u0259ndq] or sixth [siksq]). So there is no suffix test in English for separating vowel- and consonant-final words.\r\n   In fact, not even enclitics make this distinction. It is only enclitics that have a nonsyllabic allomorph that are possible candidates for the test. These all begin with a vowel or a glide in their full allomorph. Of them, and will not do, since \u2018n\u2019 is always syllabic ([\u0259n] or [n$]). Likewise are [\u0259] also only has a syllabic allomorph.

The distribution of [m], (4e), is very limited (it occurs only in I\u2019m [ajm] \u223c [am]), so it is also useless for our purpose.\r\n   This leaves us with two clitics, have [v] and will [l]. English words regularly do not end in a checked vowel, but unstressed function words may do so, providing us with examples of the two relevant nonsyllabic clitics after a (checked) vowel.

The data in the middle column are variable, [v] may, while [l] may not occur after [j] (or after a diphthong, under the alternative analysis).

STRESSED AND UNSTRESSED VOWELS\r\nVowel quality in English is related to stress. The general wisdom is that one vowel, schwa, only occurs unstressed, the other vowels may either be stressed or unstressed. There is some confusion about the use of the term \u201cstress\u201d, however. In many descriptions of English, this term is used synonymously with accent. It is certainly true that any vowel may occur without accent in English, but if we avoid the conflation of \u201cstress\u201d and \u201caccent\u201d, then a stressed vowel will be identical to a full vowel (and an unstressed vowel to a reduced vowel). In this terminology, which is what I follow in this paper, it is not the case that any vowel may be unstressed in English. In fact, all vowels in the inventory introduced in (3) occur stressed, but only a subset of that inventory occurs unstressed.\r\n   The set of reduced (or unstressed) vowels includes schwa and two further vowels, KIT and FOOT, transcribed as [i] and [u], respectively, by Jones (1917), and as [\u026a] and [\u028a] by Gimson (1962). The second vowel in each of the following words is unstressed and together they illustrate all the possibilities: comet [kom\u0259t], comic [komik], communal [komjun\u0259l]. All three vowels occur preconsonantally, as in these examples.\r\n   Word finally FOOT and GOOSE were in free variation earlier, with the latter gaining the upper hand. Jones transcribes value as [\u02c8v\u00e6lju\u02d0] with the alternant [-ju] added in brackets, implying it is the less frequent form (1917, xx), furthermore, he adds that for many words the variant with the short vowel is available, but not indicated in the dictionary (1917, xxx). We find this solution all the way up to the 14th edition (Gimson 1977). Both the 15th edition (Jones 1997) and the LPD (Wells 1990) lack the variant with FOOT altogether.\r\n   Word-final reduced KIT has also been replaced by a long vowel, FLEECE. This change is called HAPPY-tensing (Wells 1982). To parallel the name, let us call the former change VALUE-tensing.HAPPY- and VALUE-tensing are claimed to take place not only word finally, but in prevocalic position, too. Wells (1990), who uses the redundant Gimsonian system [\u026a]/[i\u02d0] and [\u028a]/[u\u02d0] for transcribing the high vowels KIT/FLEECE and FOOT/GOOSE, applies two further symbols to represent the transition from the pre-HAPPY/VALUE-tensing state of the language (where these words have [\u026a] and [\u028a]) to the post-tensing state (with [i\u02d0] and [u\u02d0]), the \u201ctransitional\u201d symbols are [i] and [u]. Accordingly, he has create [kri\u02c8e\u026at], where [i] is an abbreviation for \u201cmore conservative speakers may have [\u026a] here, others have [i\u02d0]\u201d, and statuette [\u02ccst\u00e6t\u0283u\u02c8et], where [u] is similarly an abbreviation for FOOT or GOOSE. Since these symbols only occur in unstressed position, that is, they represent reduced vowels, they could be called schwee and schwoo, respectively (Lindsey 2012b). Word finally Wells does not apply schwoo, since, as we have noted above, VALUE-tensing has completed in standard British English in this position.

In fact, there is a sixth member of this set: GOAT. Jones claims that [ou] has an allophone [o] \u201cin certain unstressed positions\u201d (1917, xxxv). This vowel is represented by [ou], the italicized offglide is \u201coptional\u201d. It is most common before a consonant, especially at the end of what looks like a learned prefix, but elsewhere too: both positions are exemplified by automobile [\u02c8\u0254\u02d0toumoubi\u02d0l]. We also find this symbol before a vowel (Genoa [\u02c8d\u0292enou\u0259]). Interestingly, the word-final occurrence of this alternation is rather rare, Jones indicates it in fellow, but not arrow, borrow, hallow, window unless followed by a vowel-initial suffix or in a compound: fellow [\u02c8felou] vs. arrow [\u02c8\u00e6rou] vs. arrowy [\u02c8\u00e6roui], arrow-head [\u02c8\u00e6rouhed].\r\n   British English underwent a vowel change that is relevant from our point of view, GOATfronting (or advancement, Wells 1982, 237). The shift of the first part of earlier [ou] into [\u0259u] is already mentioned by Jones (1917), but it is given graphical recognition only much later by Gimson (1962), as [\u0259\u028a], and Jones (1967), as [\u0259u]. With this change, the marginal reduced vowel [o], which was in free variation with [\u0259], has disappeared from dictionaries. It has been replaced by the canonical reduced vowel, [\u0259].\r\n   As a result, in current British English we have six reduced vowels. Three of the six checked vowels may occur in unstressed position: KIT ([i]), STRUT ([\u0259]), and FOOT ([u]); and three free vowels may also occur here: FLEECE ([ij]), GOAT ([\u0259w]), and GOOSE ([uw]).\r\n   None of the R vowels, that is, the long monophthongs, may occur unstressed. This follows from universal tendencies of stressability. For example, Hayes claims that \u201cCV counts as a light syllable. It is probable that long-vowelled syllables universally count as heavy; [... b]ut CVC syllables vary: in some languages they are heavy, in others light\u201d (1995, 120). Accordingly, we can set up the stressability scale in (6), where \u201c>\u201d means the item on the left is more stressable than the one on the right.\r\n(6) The stressability scale\r\nVV$ > VC$ > V$\r\nAll the vowels in the inventory I posit in (3) may be stressed (this is because schwa is claimed here to be equivalent to STRUT, cf. Fabricius 2007; Szigetvari 2018), but only a subset of them may be unstressed. Because of this, what we need is the opposite of the stressability scale, that is, an \u201cunstressability\u201d scale. This is given in (7).\r\n(7) The unstressability scale\r\nV$ > VC$ > VV$\r\nThe scale shows that the R vowels (VV) are the least unstressable vowels, and indeed, in English they only occur stressed. We have mentioned above that free vowel\u00feschwa sequences alternate with R vowels. However, this only occurs in stressed position, so idea may be [ajd\u0131\u02d0], but India may not be p[\u0131ndi\u02d0], secure may be [sikju\u02d0], but jaguar may not be p[d\u0292a\u0261ju\u02d0]. This follows from the nonoccurrence of long vowels in unstressed position.\r\n   But its quantity is not the only factor that determines the unstressability of a vowel. Not all checked vowels and not all free vowels may occur unstressed. Let us first look at the six checked vowels. They may be arranged in the format shown in (8).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3374, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85a4ab7d-eb9f-4648-a52f-9e15947f13a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "85a4ab7d-eb9f-4648-a52f-9e15947f13a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1566, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c91448e-1eb1-4941-92ae-9fca0000fbfc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1566, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "f68da35a4ada6c1079385403810546dfaa5f4dc49bc492385b28fe84db35dc79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(8) The checked vowels\r\n\t\u201cnonlow\u201d\ti\t\u0259 u\tunstressable\r\n\t\u201cnonhigh\u201d\te\ta\to\tnot unstressable\r\nIn defence of the indeterminate labels \u201cnonlow\u201d and \u201cnonhigh\u201d it must be noted that the vowels of the top line are not necessarily high, but they are certainly not low. Similarly, those of the bottom line are not all low, but certainly none of them is high. Kenstowicz (1997) shows that in some languages the stressability scale does not only involve quantity, but also quality. Put simply the more sonorous, that is, the more open a vowel, the more stressable it is. This is exactly what we find in English, too: the closer, less sonorous vowel of each pair, [i], [\u0259], and [u], may occur unstressed, the opener, more sonorous ones, [e], [a], and [o], may not. So opener vowels are less \u201cunstressable\u201d than closer ones. More concretely, they are not unstressable, while closer ones are. Thus the fact that [i], [\u0259], and [u] may occur in unstressed position in English, while [e], [a], and [o] may not follows from universals of language.\r\n   However, we have seen that some of the free vowels, traditionally classified as diphthongs, may also occur in unstressed position. We are going to examine them in the next section.\r\n4. UNSTRESSED FREE VOWELS\r\nWe have seen that HAPPY-tensing is responsible for the creation of a word-final and prevocalic unstressed free vowel, FLEECE. Two further free vowels occur unstressed, GOAT and GOOSE. If we organize the free vowels as we have in (8) according to their first element, we get the arrangement in (9).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1539, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c85d109c-7f52-452c-bacc-e4faa7f7cbf9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c85d109c-7f52-452c-bacc-e4faa7f7cbf9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-8.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3011, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad96447d-577c-4fb2-83a9-c522a3cf81d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-8.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3011, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "30eb9cbcee228d27e27baeabed853c360ee3b7b8db382c2d4ece25d53789ca6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(9)\tThe free vowels\r\n\t\u201cnonlow\u201d\tij\t\u0259w\tuw\tunstressable\r\n\t\u201cnonhigh\u201d\tej\taj aw\toj\tnot unstressable\r\nIf we do not accept it as a mere accident that the first element in the free vowels occurring unstressed is the same three checked vowels that occur unstressed, then the simplest explanation is that these are, in fact, the same three vowels, [i], [\u0259], and [u], followed by a consonant, [j] and [w]. But there are further arguments for this analysis.\r\n   In light of the unstressability scale of (7), HAPPY-tensing is a suspicious phenomenon. Why should an unstressed light syllable become heavy? The vowel in an unstressed syllable is expected to become \u201csimpler\u201d, shorter, closer, but not longer or a diphthong. I argue that HAPPYtensing is not the fortition of a vowel, rather it is the consequence of the generalization of a phonotactic constraint of English.\r\n   In the interpretation advocated in this paper, the input of this change is [i] and the output is [ij]. This change is the \u201cfortition\u201d of the vowel, only if [ij] is a diphthong, that is, a single unit. If, however, it is the short vowel, [i], followed by a consonant, [j], then this change is the epenthesis of a consonant. Word finally this consonant is epenthesized because word-final short vowels are dispreferred in English. Prevocalically, this consonant is epenthesized because prevocalic vowels (that is, hiatus) are also strongly dispreferred in English.\r\n   We have seen that stressed short vowels do not occur either word finally or prevocalically. In the accent described by Jones and Gimson, the unstressed short vowels [i] and [u] could occur in these positions: happy [hapi], India [\u0131ndi\u0259], value [valju], jaguar [d\u0292a\u0261ju\u0259], and unstressed [\u0259] can occur word finally, but not prevocalically. The constraint against short vowels in word-final and prevocalic position has been generalized to unstressed position, which triggers the insertion (or, in the case of [uw], the retention) of the glide after these two short unstressed vowels. Most importantly, in neither case does this change make the syllable heavy, which would entail that it is less unstressable. It is well-known that word-final consonants are not moraic in English, so the glide does not add to the weight of the final syllable in the changes from [hapi] to [hapij] or [valju] to [valjuw]. The glide that appears between two vowels, as in the changes from [\u0131ndi\u0259] to [\u0131ndij\u0259] or [d\u0292a\u0261ju\u0259] to [d\u0292a\u0261juw\u0259], is an onset, hence it does not contribute to weight either. That is, the unstressed syllables involved in HAPPY-tensing and VALUE-tensing remain light, hence fully unstressable.\r\n   The appearance of a [j] and [w] after [i] and [u] in unstressed word-final and prevocalic position is thus the result of the extension of the constraint against short vowels in these positions. However, only if we analyse these two glides as consonants will they not contribute to the weight of the unstressed syllables they seem to appear in.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2970, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a822f1ab-4767-4d81-96a4-d16b143d8335": {"__data__": {"id_": "a822f1ab-4767-4d81-96a4-d16b143d8335", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-9.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2138, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed949611-8a38-400c-9ec3-9bbf97efc3b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-4-9.txt", "file_name": "settext-4-9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2138, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "77ce447dda39804cd0318c99ec0875e3d4db85d2e6b4d48f2967bd5bab5f66d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "On several occasions I have hinted at the fact that while in HAPPY-tensing a short vowel turned into a diphthong, or rather, as we now see, a short vowel, [i], followed by a consonant, [j], in VALUE-tensing it is a diphthong, that is, the short vowel [u] followed by the consonant [w] that did not lose its glide. The same holds for unstressed GOAT: this vowel is [\u0259w] (or, rather, [ow]) historically, and it may lose its [w]. But this loss may never occur prevocalically, and even word finally, it is a rare event (e.g., fellow [fel\u0259w] ]). However, both unstressed GOOSE and unstressed GOAT may lose their glide before a consonant. So unite may be [juwnajt] or [junajt],volume may be [voljuwm] or [voljum]. We find similar alternations with unstressed GOAT (as we have already seen above in the case of Jones\u2019s variable [ou]): obey [\u0259(w)bej], Eothen [\u0131j\u0259(w)qen]. In fact, the glide is obligatorily dropped before an unstressed syllable: while stimulate varies, [st\u0131mju(w)lejt], stimulus does not, [st\u0131mju(pw)l\u0259s]; advocaat [adv\u0259(w)ka\u02d0] vs. advocate [adv\u0259(pw)k\u0259t].

In the following sentence the tonic is underlined: \r\nThe children managed to carry the suitcases as far as the edge of the r\u00f3undabout. \r\nThe End-Weight Principle is satisfied through a Tonic Assignment Rule: \r\nTonic Assignment Rule \r\n\t1  1 \u2192 2  1 \t= of several primary stresses, downgrade each to secondary, \r\nexcept the last, which will be the tonic. \r\nExample:    1  \t1\t1        1 \t  \u2192 \t  2\t2\t2        1      Rachel was happy to cycle home \tRachel was happy to cycle home \r\nThe same mechanism is at work in many compounds: \r\n    1    1      \u2192   2      1   1      1      1 \u2192   2   2 1 \r\nphoto montage photomontage second  world  war     Second World War \r\nIt follows that the \u201csecondariness\u201d of secondary stress is predictable: a secondary stress is actually a stress which is followed by another stress and has therefore been downgraded. Secondary stress is thus an \u201callophone\u201d of primary stress. Lexically, we may represent words like reformation, satisfactory, sardine with two equal \u201cprimary\u201d stresses: \r\n     //\u02c8ref\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n// //\u02c8s\u00e6t\u026as\u02c8f\u00e6kt\u0259ri// //\u02c8s\u0251:\u02c8di:n// because the Tonic Assignment Rule will turn the first stress into secondary anyway: /\u02ccref\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n/  /\u02ccs\u00e6t\u026as\u02c8f\u00e6kt\u0259ri/ /\u02ccs\u0251:\u02c8di:n/ \r\nWe conclude that primary and secondary stress in an allophonic relationship (complementary distribution), and can be seen as two realizations of the same thing: stress (or \u201cmajor stress\u201d)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2058, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "169fcf83-4093-4389-9dbd-6719a2317875": {"__data__": {"id_": "169fcf83-4093-4389-9dbd-6719a2317875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-10.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4485, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "991d611b-1948-4013-b822-f570e8a99747", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-10.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4485, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "f82d4a627a5f1d9f9848a2575d35f274e7a9aec8131ee68a99d52dfa6b94fa52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.6. TONIC PLACEMENT \r\n \r\nThis section will examine the rules for tonic placement, that is, choosing the word that receives the strongest (= last major) stress in a tone unit.10 The place of the tonic can be neutral11 (i.e. unmarked), or dislocated (i.e. marked, typically contrastive). The neutral tonic has no special communicative value, and is prescribed by general rules. The dislocated tonic is placed by the speaker on some other word than where it would normally fall, in order to express some communicative surplus by highlighting some element. \r\n\r\n7.6.1. Neutral Tonic \r\n \r\n7.6.1.1. On the last content word \r\nThe neutral tonic falls on the last content-word of the tone-unit. This is the Last ContentWord Rule. If the last words are function-words, they remain unstressed because these are not \u201ctonic-bearing\u201d. The neutral tonic is mechanically assigned: the tonic need not be the most \u201cimportant\u201d or communicatively most informative word. For example: \r\n \r\n \t\u2032Pat\u2019s \u2032father is an ex\u2032tremely \u2032rich  man. \t \tI \u2032hope you can rermember them. \r\n \tA\u2032manda \u2032made some de\u2032licious \u2032fruit fsalad.  \t\u2032What was your umubrella like?  \t\u2032Turn \u2032left towards the  car ferry. \t \t \tThey \u2032couldn\u2019t .wait for us. \r\n \r\n \r\n7.6.1.2. On a function-word \r\nThe neutral tonic may, in well-defined cases, fall on some function word. We will discuss only two of these cases: neutral tonic on an auxiliary, and on an adverbial particle. \r\n\uf020\r\n\uf0b7 Neutral tonic and auxiliaries. An auxiliary (including the finite forms of be, do, have) has the tonic if there is no further stressable word in the sentence: \u2032Yes, we )may.  \u2013  \u2032Jim \u2032always .does. \u2013 This includes questions where the auxiliary is followed by its unstressed personal pronoun subject: \u2032How ex\u2032pensive .is it?  \u2013  \u2032Where  am I?  \u2013  \u2032How  are you? \r\nHowever, when a sentence-final auxiliary is preceded by its own stressed subject, the tonic falls on the subject and the auxiliary is unstressed (but strong, i.e. tertiary-stressed!): \r\n \tYou \u2032play \u2032better than  Joe does. \t \tI \u2032wonder \u2032when the eexam will be. \r\n \t\u2032That\u2019s the \u2032pub where my  friends are. \tIt \u2032fits me \u2032better than .yours would. \r\nA final auxiliary is never reduced to zero stress.  \r\n \r\nNeutral tonic and adverbial particles. An adverbial particle12 forms part of a phrasal verb: \r\nget up, put off. The particle has no weak form, and is usually stressed:  \r\n \tYou should \u2032get \u2032up before  six. \u2013 I \u2032couldn\u2019t \u2032ring you \u2032back on  Tuesday. \r\n\uf0b7 Sentence-finally (possibly followed by non-stressable words), it can have two kinds of stressing: \r\n(a) It is tonic-bearing after a verb or after an unstressed pronoun: \r\n \t\u2032Get  up! \t \t\u2032Please \u2032put that !down. \t    The \u2032meeting was \u2032called .off.  \t\u2032It\u2019 \u02c8hard to \u02c8get .out of it. \t \t\u2032Shall I \u2032wrap one  up for you? \r\n(b) It is unstressed after a noun. This is the only case when a final adverbial particle is unstressed: \r\n \t\u2032Take your  coat off! \t \t \t \t\u2032Tim\u2019s \u2032got to \u2032call his !mother back. \r\n \t\u2032Please \u2032put that  gun down. \t \t \t\u2032Liz \u2032promised to \u2032put the .children up. \r\nThe verb before the particle may lose its stress due to Medial Stress-Deletion, as break in The \u2032car \u2032didn\u2019t obreak  down. A phrasal verb is thus stressed either on both components (\u2032get \r\n\u2032up), or on the particle only (get \u2032up). \r\n Let us remark that prepositions behave differently from adverbial particles in syntax as well as in prosody. Laugh at, deal with, sit on are Prepositional verbs13 (verbs requiring a prepositional complement), while call off, break up, put on are Phrasal Verbs (Verb + Adverbial Particle). There is a syntactic differene: I [put on] the hat \u2013 I sat [on the hat]. A preposition normally appears in a reduced (\u201cweak\u201d) form, while adverbial particles have no weak form. The words at, for, from, of, to, with, without are only used as prepositions, never as adverbial particles, while other words (up, off, etc.) can function as either. \r\n \tA phrasal verb may be followed by a preposition, e.g. hang on to (\u2018insist\u2019), get away with \r\n(\u2018escape\u2019), go in for (\u2018enjoy\u2019). The stress of such combinations follows the rules outlined so far: the adverbial particle is stressed, the preposition unstressed. Examples: \r\n \t\u2032Don\u2019t hang \u2032on to this \u2032stupid iidea. \t \t\u2032Don\u2019t hang .on to it. \r\n \t\u2032What is he \u2032hanging  on to? \t \t \t\u2032Don\u2019t hang \u2032on to  THAT!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 4288, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17b753b4-68b3-4fa6-b76a-36a59a240a92": {"__data__": {"id_": "17b753b4-68b3-4fa6-b76a-36a59a240a92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-11.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4749, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a18beb26-1c35-4de0-ab56-7c8598c0b682", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-11.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4749, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "b6494629613f799156ba838d2092688c33bfc3ff43554a98539a3064434250b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.6.2. Dislocated Tonic Placement \r\nIn order to focus some part of the message, to contrast it with something, or to highlight it as new information, the tonic may be dislocated, i.e. placed elsewhere than the neutralplacement rules would prescribe. Compare: \r\n(a) She spent a year in the Sforest.  \t\u2013 neutral tonic placement \r\n(b) She spent a SYEAR in the forest. \t\u2013 dislocated tonic placement \r\nA dislocated tonic need not be louder than the other stresses \u2013 it is just earlier or later than it would be in the neutral stress pattern. (In the following examples the dislocated tonic is printed in CAPITALS.) \r\n In everyday life people use the word \u201cstress\u201d exactly for this kind of emphasis, and not for the syllabic prominence that \u201cstress\u201d means to the linguist. People say: The headmaster stressed that our school was a traditional one, meaning that he laid special emphasis on tradition. (The same is done in Hungarian, where the everyday meaning of \u201changs\u00faly(oz)\u201d is similarly \u201cemphasis, emphasize\u201d:  z igazgat\u00f3 hangs\u00falyozta...). The layman would say that in sentence (a) above we \u201cdidn\u2019t stress anything\u201d, while in (b) we \u201cstressed\u201d that it was a whole year. From a linguistic point of view, the word year is stressed in both (a) and (b); but in (b) it is made emphatic by receiving a dislocated tonic. \r\n \r\n \r\n7.6.2.1. Dislocated tonic for contrast \r\nThe tonic may be dislocated in order to contrast one element (a word, a morpheme, or a grammatical feature, like tense). \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 (A) LEXICAL CONTRAST  \r\nA frequent case of dislocated tonic placement is lexical contrast, when the speaker emphasizes a word which is earlier than the tonic. For example \r\n \t \tJane  BOUGHT three rabbits at the market.  (She did not sell them.) \r\n \t \tTim was so drunk he literally  CRAWLED out of the pub.  (instead of walking) \r\nEven the verb be can be lexically contrasted: \r\n \t \t(She sounds Welsh to me.) \u2014 \u2032That\u2019s be\u02c8cause she  IS Welsh. \r\n \t \t(It tasted like bad wine.)  \u2014  It  WAS bad wine. \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 (B) VERBAL CONTRASTS: MODALITY AND YES/NO POLARITY  \r\nAnother type of contrast that we express with a dislocated tonic concerns the mood, tense, or positive/negative value (the \u201cpolarity\u201d) of the verb. The two sentences below show these three types of difference: \r\n(a) Tim will enjoy the perpformance.  (neutral tonic)  \t \t \t(indicative mood, future tense, positive polarity) \r\n(b) Tim TWON\u2019T enjoy the performance. \r\n \t \t \t(indicative mood, future tense, negative polarity) \r\nThis is not lexical contrast since the verb (enjoy) is the same: the speaker is not contrasting one verb with another, but is contrasting the accompanying values of the same verb. In modality and polarity contrast, the dislocated tonic always falls on an auxiliary. If there is no auxiliary (in the simple present or past), the auxiliary do has to come in to bear the tonic. \r\n\r\n\uf0b7\uf0b7 (i) Verbal modality (mood and tense) contrast  \r\n\u201cMood\u201d, for our purposes, includes not only indicative and conditional, but also meanings expressed by the modal auxiliaries (can, could, ought to, etc.). The category \u201ctense\u201d covers all verbal categories including aspect like continuous (= progressive), passive, etc. \r\n \r\n \t(Has Sue gone to France?) \u2014 No, but she  MIGHT go. \r\n \t(When will the students write the application?) \u2014 They  ARE writing it. \r\n \t(Why don\u2019t you try the cheesecake?) \u2014 I  HAVE tried it, thanks. \r\n \t(I think Tim works at a hospital.)  \u2014  He  DID work there (...but doesn\u2019t any more).  \t(You should use this dictionary.)  \u2014  We  DO use it. \r\n \t(Shouldn\u2019t Joe study classical music?) \u2014 He  DOES study classical music. \r\n \r\n\uf0b7\uf0b7 (ii) Yes/No polarity (positive/negative) contrast  \r\nThe other type of non-lexical contrast in verbs concerns \u201cpolarity\u201d, namely, positive (= affirmative) versus negative meaning. Polarity contrast (answering \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cno\u201d, or vice versa) is again achieved by placing the tonic on the auxiliary: \r\n \r\n \t(Sue can learn it on her own.) \u2014 She  CAN\u2019T learn it on her own.  \t(You can\u2019t come in because you\u2019re not members.) \u2014 We (ARE members. \r\n \t(I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve bought the tickets.) \u2014 We  HAVEN\u2019T bought them. \r\n \t(You don\u2019t like fish and chips, I suppose.) \u2014 I  DO like fish and chips. \r\n \t(It\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t write to Liz.) \u2014 I  DID write to her. \r\n \r\nRemember that do- forms or other auxiliaries are not needed in cases of lexical contrast, where the verb itself must be stressed: \r\n \t \t(Was Tim ill in hospital for so long?) \u2014 No, he  WORKED there. \r\n \t \t(Why don\u2019t you throw away this old dictionary?) \u2014 We  USE it! \r\n \t \t(Joe teaches classical music, doesn\u2019t he?) \u2014 He  STUDIES classical music.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 4604, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bbc79e3-211c-4a56-9c92-fddb4125bca1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bbc79e3-211c-4a56-9c92-fddb4125bca1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-12.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1708, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "974d8534-8117-4fb5-9b6f-6d0f3e2be8be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-12.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1708, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "7e608d44a90dd0336060c9502e9b537edd17bc397cfd4a5a7e85071bcd674419", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.6.2.2. Dislocated tonic for highlighting new information \r\nThe speaker may consider some part of his sentence as \u201cold\u201d information, known both to him and the listener.

INTONATION \r\n \r\nIn the preceding sections we discussed one component of prosody: stress. We now turn to the other prosodic component: intonation. While stress concerns the loudness of syllables, intonation concerns their height, called \u201cpitch\u201d in linguistics.14 People easily confuse a high pitch with a loud stress: these often appear together, but are not the same (see the examples in 7.1). Intonation includes two things only: the melodies or \u201ctones\u201d (with their meanings and functions), and the division of speech into tone-units (that is, where one intonation pattern ends and the next one begins).15 \r\n The pitch of the speaker\u2019s voice is influenced by several factors. (a) natural factors (= \u201csymptoms\u201d) like sex and age: women and children have a higher pitch than men, and every person has a characteristic pitch; (b) paralinguistic factors: an excited speaker will use a higher pitch than someone who is tired or bored; (c) linguistic factors: the pitch may depend on whether the utterance is a question or a command, old or new information, encouraging or neutral. These linguistic factors belong to the field of intonation.  \r\n Besides pitch, speech has other features like loudness and tempo, and is accompanied by gestures and facial expressions (sometimes called \u201cbody language\u201d), all of which are important for communication, but do not form part of the linguistic system.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1396, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6c599e2-aa18-4b2c-aab1-4bf92ffa5a26": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6c599e2-aa18-4b2c-aab1-4bf92ffa5a26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-14.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3976, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72597543-4614-4c6d-804b-b5959c227066", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-14.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3976, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "3f75283aab2a559b60fc7418cb2afdb815a4aa013386970f0814bcd463a37fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.7.1. The components of intonation \r\nIn speech the height of a given syllable is called pitch. In phonology the linguistically relevant (= \u201cphonemic\u201d) pitch changes are examined: this is what we call intonation. In every tone-unit, the last stress, the tonic, is accompanied by pitch change, i.e. the voice falls or rises on that syllable. The pitch-change attached to a tonic syllable is a tone. \r\n \r\nThe English tones \r\nEnglish has four phonologically distinct tones. One is falling, three are rising. \r\n\r\n \r\nIntonation can be represented with lines actually depicting the rising or falling of the voice. The tone (= the pitch change on the tonic syllable) is shown with a thick line. \r\nExample 1. Falling tone. \r\n \t \t \thigh \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \t \t \tmid \r\n \t \t \tlow \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n \t \t \t \t We de \u2032cided to  \u2032come  \u2032back in Oc  tober.  \t \t \t \t{pre-h} {.......h......e......a......d........} {tn}{tl} \r\nThe following points deserve comment: \r\n\u2013 The pre-head (We de-), containing only unstressed syllables, is spoken at a low pitch.  \r\n\u2013 The head (-cided to come back in Oc-) begins with a high pitch, and gradually becomes lower as we proceed towards the tonic (\u201cdowndrift\u201d).16 \r\n\u2013 The tonic syllable (-to-) has the only radical pitch change: the tone starts here. The height of the voice suddenly changes on this syllable. (Our example has a falling tone). \r\n\u2013 The tail (-ber) adds nothing to the intonation, it simply continues where the tonic has pushed it (in this case at a low level). \r\n \r\nExample 2. High-rising tone. The rise here is realized on one syllable (car), as there is no tail. There is no pre-head either. The head starts high, the pitch descends gradually as far as the end of the head; there the pitch suddenly breaks its descent, and rises from low to high on the tonic syllable: \r\n   high \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    mid    low \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n \t \t \t \t   \u2032Did  you  \u2032park  the     car? \r\n The falling or rising nature of the intonation of a tone-unit is determined by the tonic. If the tonic has a falling tone, we call the whole intonation falling, no matter where it began or what happened in the pre-head or head. If the tonic is rising, we call the whole intonation rising, though the sentence may actually end on a lower pitch than where it began. \r\n \r\nDowndrift \r\nThe gradual lowering of the pitch within the tone unit\u2019s head is called downdrift.17 Downdrift itself does not count as falling intonation. Compare the examples again: the downdrifting heads are highlighted with parallel lines: \r\n \t \t \t \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\nFALLING INTON. \r\n \t \t \t \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n \t \t \t \t We de \u2032cided to  \u2032come  \u2032back in Oc  tober. \r\n \r\n \t \t \t \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\nHIGH-RISING INTON. \r\n \t \t \t \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n \t \t \t \t   \u2032Did  you  \u2032park  the     car? \r\nBoth sentences have downdrift in their heads. However, the first sentence has falling intonation, the second rising, because their tonics are falling and rising respectively. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe intonation of the tail  \r\nIf there is a tail, the tone spreads out over the tail: the syllables in the tail continue the movement set by the tonic.  \r\n \t \t \tFalling tone:  \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \t \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\r\n \r\n \t \t \t \t \t \r\n \t \t \t \t \t \r\n \r\n \t \t \tHigh-rising tone: \r\n \r\n \t \t \t \t \t \r\n \t \t \t \t \t \r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\u2014Usually. \t \r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\u2014Usually? \t \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n  Using  it. \r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n   Using  it? \r\n \r\nWe see that when the tone is falling, the syllables in the tail continue low.

The fall-rise is able to express partial negation (see the (b) sentences below), implying that the thing is true on the whole, but some part of it is negated. While ordinary full negation (a), expressed by the fall, simply means \u201cno\u201d, the partial negation expressed by the fall-rise means \u201cyes, but...\u201d.

It expresses the following meanings or attitudes: \r\n(a) Indifference. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is true but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important or interesting or relevant.\u201d It sounds as if the speaker was shrugging while saying these sentences.  (What\u2019s your favourite colour?) \u2014 Blue. (What a childish question.) \r\n.\r\n \t(I suppose you don\u2019t dare to tell your wife.) \u2014 She knows. (It makes no difference.) \r\n.\r\n \t(Did you enjoy the performance?) \u2014 It was all right. (Nothing special.) \r\n.\r\n(b) Encouragement. The low rise is used to encourage or comfort the hearer and to sound reassuring. It sounds as if the speaker meant, \u201cno problem, nothing serious, relax\u201d. \uf0b7 Encouragement to do something, not to worry, etc. Often used to children. \r\n \t\u2032Don\u2019t worry. \t \tI \u2032don\u2019t mind. \tWe \u2032shouldn\u2019t be a fraid. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\uf0b7 Encouragement to continue speaking (\u201cI\u2019m listening, go on!\u201d): \r\n \tYes. \t \tIs \u2032that so? \t \t\u2032That\u2019s interesting.  \tNo. (but tell me) \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nIt is also used with the polite tag ...will/won\u2019t you?, attached to imperatives. The imperative base sentence has a falling tone: \r\n \tHelp your self, | won\u2019t you? \t \r\n \r\n(c) Greetings, thanks, apologies. \r\nCome and lend a Chand, | will you? \r\n \r\n \t\u2032Good morning.  \t\u2032No thanks.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\u2032Bye- bye. \r\n.\r\n \tI\u2019m sorry. \t \tEx cuse me.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\u2032See you soon. \r\n.\r\nTo sum up: the low rise is mostly a response, something added to other sentences. It can express indifference and lack of importance. Due to its \u201clightness\u201d it can also be used to express encouragement and greetings. It is not used for questions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5, "end_char_idx": 2522, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "144064dc-0dbf-4d2b-9f0c-579035d9f437": {"__data__": {"id_": "144064dc-0dbf-4d2b-9f0c-579035d9f437", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-18.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2239, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee94f038-2394-405e-b5b5-e8aa9a3eb826", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-18.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2239, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "7b66973be0847b368afeed2b8d276036a630e0a10c5fd8e99901d60fccdb4aea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.7.2.4.

If there is a tail in the English high rise, Hungarian learners will tend to use their rise-fall. This is dangerous for communication as the English ear will only hear the fall at the end, and interpret the intonation as falling, i.e. not a question. \r\nFunction \r\n(a) The high rise is mostly used in Yes/No questions, whether they are grammatically wellformed interrogative sentences or not. \r\n\u2032Did you \u2032park the \u2032car?  \t \t\u2032Could I \u2032bring it \u2032back on ?Saturday? \u2032One of the teditors? \t \tdAre you? \t \t Birmingham? \r\n(b) \u201cPlease-repeat\u201d questions. These are Wh-questions asking for the repetition of something just heard. Such \u201cplease-repeat\u201d questions have a dislocated tonic on the question word. \r\n(Jennifer is in Kuala Lumpur.) \u2014 (WHERE\u2019s Jennifer?? \r\n(Watson will be the new chief editor.) \u2014 (WHO\u2019ll be the new chief editor?? (My girlfriend is thirteen.) \u2014  HOW old is she?? \r\nThe question-word bearing the tonic can also remain in the syntactic place where the questioned element stands in the statement. In this case the word order is not question-like: \r\n(She bought herself a platypus.) \u2014 She bought herself a (WHAT?? \r\n(We\u2019ve got tickets for the 2am performance.) \r\n\u2014 You\u2019ve got tickets for \u2014WHICH performance?? \r\n\r\n(Z\u00f6l\u2191de\u2193ket?

Stress Degrees in connected speech \r\nThe effects of the End-Weight Principle are well known in the analysis of word stress: \u2013 if a word has two (rarely three) stresses, the last must be the primary, the one(s) before it secondary. Consequently, there cannot be a secondary after the primary. 1\r\n\u2013 strong-unstressed syllables (f\u00f3rmat /-m\u00e6t/, dir\u00e9ct /da\u026a-/) are also called \u201ctertiarystressed\u201d because their vowel does not reduce (as it would in completely unstressed syllables like s\u00e1lad /-l\u0259d/ or \u00d3xford /-f\u0259d/). From the prosodic point of view, however, 3ry and zero stresses do not count as stresses because the End-Weight Principle does not \u201csee\u201d them: they can never become 1ry-stressed.  \r\nWe conclude that in prosody there are only two phonologically relevant stress degrees: \r\nstressed (1ry or 2ry) and unstressed (3ry or zero). \r\nSTRESS DEGREES \r\nexample (underlined) \r\nurbanization \r\n/\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/ \r\nurbanization /\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/ \r\nurbanization \r\n/\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/ \r\nurbanization \r\n/\u02cc\u025c:b\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283n/ \r\nword-level: \r\nprimary str. \r\nsecondary str. \r\ntertiary str. \r\nzero str. \r\nprosodic: \r\ns t r e s s e d \r\n(= major-stressed) \r\nu n s t r e s s e d \r\n\t(strong)       \t          (weak) \r\nWe shall occasionally mention (and indicate) secondary stress, but generally we shall just speak of stressed and unstressed syllables \u2013 or, more simply, stressed and unstressed words (meaning that their primary-stressable syllable is stressed or unstressed).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1461, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aa42131-c88c-47d8-a2df-7d4169826190": {"__data__": {"id_": "8aa42131-c88c-47d8-a2df-7d4169826190", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-3.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1833, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b24ab02d-ea24-41af-9ff6-51a4b0b39de9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-3.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1833, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "f5c8ad32d68ca02b2453df3a0439988f54819530de97efaf788b04aa8662998b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.3. COMPOUND WORDS \r\n \r\nA compound is a lexical unit (a lexeme) made up of two or more free stems (= words), e.g. gr\u00e9enhouse, to ill-tr\u00e9at, car ferry, unemployment benefit. Compounds usually have a specialized meaning: a bl\u00e1ckbird is a special type of bird, not any bird that is black. Compounds behave as units from the point of view of grammar (syntactically) and meaning (semantically).  \r\n \tFrom a phonological point of view there are two types of compound:  \r\n \t\uf0b7 initially-stressed compounds, pattern  #  1  #  3  # \r\n \t \tprimary stress on the first element: gr\u00e9enhouse, c\u00e1r ferry, comp\u00fater virus \r\n \t\uf0b7 finally-stressed compounds, pattern #  2  #  1  # \r\n  primary stress on the second element: trade \u00fanion, fruit s\u00e1lad, Victoria St\u00e1tion The type depends on the syntactic relationship between the two elements, their frequency, or degree of lexicalization. The meaning or communicative \u201cimportance\u201d of the elements is not decisive. \r\n The spelling of compounds in English is not consistent. Some are written as one word (gr\u00e9enhouse), some with a hyphen (w\u00f2rd-f\u00ednal), but the majority are written as two words (c\u00e1r ferry, ge\u00f3graphy teacher, d\u00f2uble ch\u00edn). The latter may be called \u201cinvisible compounds\u201d, since the spelling does not show that they are compounds.2 \r\n When two words are just an ordinary phrase (new book) and not a compound, both elements are stressed, the second has the primary stress according to the End-Weight Principle. Observe the examples, where (a) and (b) have the same stress pattern, while (b) and (c) are compounds: \r\n \ta.

This is expressed by the following rule: \r\n(3) Compound Stress Rule \r\n#  1  #  #  1  #  \u2192  #  1  #  3  # = when compounding two words, downgrade the primary stress of the second word to strongunstressed (3ry) level. \r\n \r\nExamples for initially-stressed compounds, with the stressed element underlined: \r\n\u2022 NOUNS: gr\u00e9enhouse, c\u00e1r ferry, scr\u00e9ensaver, c\u00e1n-opener, a b\u00fayout, a wr\u00edte-off, sh\u00f3plifting, C\u00e1non Street, p\u00e1perback, p\u00e1perback writer, l\u00e1nguage teaching,  nempl\u00f3yment benefit \r\n\u2022 ADJECTIVES: w\u00e1terproof, f\u00fan-loving, ch\u00f3colate coloured, s\u00fanlit \r\n\u2022 VERBS: to b\u00e1by-sit, to h\u00e9adhunt, to b\u00e9lly-dance, to \u00e1ir-condition, to wh\u00edtewash \r\n \r\nObscured compounds.

THE TONE-UNIT \r\n \r\nA tone-unit is a stretch of speech whose last stress is a tonic (the stressed syllable on which the voice begins to fall or rise). The tone-unit usually corresponds to a sentence. If a sentence is longer, the speaker usually breaks it up into several tone-units. A typical tone-unit is We decided to come back in October. \r\n \tThe tone-unit has the following parts:  \r\n\u2013 Pre-head: the unstressed syllables before the first stress (We de-). \r\n\u2013 Head: the part beginning with the first stress and leading up to the tonic syllable (-cided to come back in Oc-). \r\n\r\n\u2013 Tonic: the last stressed syllable (-to-). \u2013 Tail: anything after the tonic (-ber).\r\nWe de- \r\n\u2032cided to \u2032come \u2032back in Oc- \r\n\r\nto- \r\nber. \r\nPre-head \r\nHead \r\nTonic \r\nTail \r\nnon-obligatory \r\nnon-obligatory \r\nobligatory \r\nnon-oblig. \r\nno stress \r\nstress(es) \r\nstress \r\nno stress \r\nincomplete foot \r\none or more feet \r\none foot \r\nT O N E - U N I T \r\n\r\nMany tone-units are not complete sentences.

For example: \r\nI \u2032think A\u2032manda should \u2032write \u2032Jennifer a \u2032letter. \r\n/aI 0FINk \u02590mAnd\u0259 S\u0259d 0raIt 0dZenIf\u0259r \u0259 0let\u0259/ \r\nWhen we say that \u201ca word is stressed\u201d, we mean that the primary-stressed syllable of that word is stressed. The place of stress within the word is not important now, that is a lexical question (Chapter 6). In this chapter it will be practical to indicate stress with separate stress marks (as in transcription), rather than with accent marks above vowels. So instead of  m\u00e1nda, J\u00e9nnifer we will write  \u2032manda, \u2032Jennifer, etc. Of course the two notations are equivalent. \r\nEnglish Phonological Analysis  Chapter 7  PROSODY (Autumn 2013)\r\n    While in isolation (as in a dictionary) one-syllable words (think, write) need not get a stress-mark, in connected speech they, too, must be stress-marked if actually stressed. Certain unstressed function-words have their \u201cweak form\u201d (here should /\u0283\u028ad/ weakens to /\u0283\u0259d/). \r\n    Punctuation (dots, commas, apostrophes, etc.) and capital letters are not shown in transcription. The only thing shown is the space between words. \r\n    Content-words are the four major word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs (including adverbial particles like up in get up). Numerals (e.g. two), interrogative and demonstrative pronouns (e.g. who?, this), and negative words (e.g. not, couldn\u2019t) are stressed like content-words. Function-words are all others: auxiliaries, most pronouns, articles, and conjunctions. Note that prepositions (e.g. with, along) also behave like function-words.6\r\nThe tonic \r\nWe have seen the working of the End-Weight Principle: if a longer word has several stresses, the last one is the strongest (the primary, as in j stific\u00e1tion). Similarly, in an English sentence the last stressed word has the strongest stress, called the tonic. The tonic is, properly speaking, a syllable (since stress is always attached to a syllable), but we will often refer to the tonic-bearing word as \u201cthe tonic word\u201d or simply \u201cthe tonic\u201d.7 For example, in We met in October, the tonic is really the syllable -to-, but we may also express this by saying that October is the tonic: We met in October. \r\n    In transcription it is not necessary to show the tonic specially, since it is by definition the last stress. If necessary, the tonic can be highlighted by underlining the syllable (or the word that contains it), and by placing an arrow in front of the tonic syllable (I or  , depending on whether the voice falls or rises there).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5, "end_char_idx": 4291, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76405bf3-8351-4054-a2c2-71505ddf5f76": {"__data__": {"id_": "76405bf3-8351-4054-a2c2-71505ddf5f76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1349, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "633d8bf9-ce61-42d7-8190-8eed84eb1698", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-7.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1349, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "540cda2a7a5484e18e247f13438b6222c9fdb29164b89f5c4bea6f81b3edcab7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.5. RHYTHM \r\n7.5.1. The Rhythmic Foot \r\n\u2014 The way stressed syllables follow each other in the \u201chead\u201d of the tone-unit is called rhythm. The unit of English rhythm is the rhythmic foot.8 A foot is a stressed syllable plus the unstressed syllables that follow it. Each tone unit is made up of one or more such feet. The first foot may be incomplete, consisting of unstressed syllables only: this is pre-head. The last foot always begins with the tonic: this is the tonic foot (consisting of tonic + tail). \r\n    The following sentence is a tone-unit consisting of five feet.

The Rhythm Rule: stress-deletion \r\nWhen three stresses come too closely together, English tends to delete the middle one to make the rhythm smoother. This is called the Rhythm Rule. The deletion means that the syllable is downgraded from 2ry to 3ry stress. There are two subcases: in one case the deleted middle stress is a short word (nice old lady); in the other it is the second stress of a word having a 2ry+1ry lexical stress (afternoon tea).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1322, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae81613a-c86d-49e9-b6a6-455bb65c762d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae81613a-c86d-49e9-b6a6-455bb65c762d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-8.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1927, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a5c826f-ba55-490e-82ec-b47bc95a537e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-5-8.txt", "file_name": "settext-5-8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1927, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "c16a009ca998b44e57859830dc95fc1a5dabcc0d18a70df6a727bd102d93bd26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.5.2.1.

Stress-shift (\u201cafternoon tea\u201d rule) \r\nIf a word with two stresses (e.g. 1after\u2032noon) is immediately followed by a stressed word, three stresses fall closely together: 1after\u2032noon \u2032tea. This is subject to the Rhythm Rule, which deletes the middle stress: \u2032afteronoon \u2032tea. But as a result, the original [2 0 1] stress pattern of the \r\nEnglish Phonological Analysis  Chapter 7  PROSODY (Autumn 2013)\r\nword 1after\u2032noon is replaced by a [2 0 3] stressing \u2032afteronoon. The word\u2019s lexical primarystressed syllable (noon) is degraded to strong-unstressed (tertiary) status.This gives the impression that the major stress in the word has \u201cshifted\u201d leftwards to the place of the secondary, and instead of the normal /\u02cc\u0251:ft\u0259\u02c8nu:n/ we now have /\u02c8\u0251:ft\u0259nu:n/.  \r\n    Due to this Stress-Shift, the stressing of many longer words or compounds is variable, depending on whether they are followed by a stressed word or not.9 Stress-Shift is most frequent in adjectives and nouns in attributive position, but it can affect practically any word that has two stresses. Examples: \r\n\t1Japa\u2032nese  \u2192  \u2032Japa onese \u2032garden; \t1demo\u2032cratic  \u2192   \u2032demo ocratic \u2032country \r\n\t1unde\u2032clared  \u2192   \u2032unde oclared \u2032goods \tto  1de\u2032ice  \u2192  to  \u2032de oice \u2032everything\r\nIt may also hit the second element of a finally-stressed compound, causing the compound to sound initially-stressed. For example, 1North \u2032Sea, when followed by \u00f3il, loses the stress on Sea and appears with shifted stress as \u2032North Sea.  \r\n\t1North \u2032Sea  \u2192  \u2032North  oSea \u2032oil \t1New \u2032Year  \u2192  \u2032New  oYear\u2019s \u2032Eve \r\n\t1duty \u2032free  \u2192   \u2032duty  ofree \u2032goods \t1World \u2032War  \u2192  \u2032World  oWar \u2032Two \r\nThe two applications of the Rhythm Rule, Medial Stress-Deletion and Stress-Shift, are basically the same: they eliminate a stress between two other stresses.

Structure versus history \r\n1.1 Introduction \r\nKnowledge of the structure of a language is quite different from knowing its history, knowing where it came from (more specifically, what the origins are of its phonological system, phonotactic rules, syntax, semantics, you name it). Structure and history (or origin, if you like) can be studied independently, and rightly so because different points of view can shed light on an entity from quite different (and surprising) angles. This means no entity will ever have just the one interpretation. (If this were possible, this one interpretation would necessarily have to be the only right one.) This course has hopefully manged to dispel this idea: no interpretation is ever the only possible (and right) one. So, rest assured neither the structural nor the historical aspect is better than the other. They are complementary, one trying to describe what the other can\u2019t or won\u2019t access.  \r\n      Up to now, very little has been said about the history of phonemes, sounds, intonational contours, etc. (or about whether such historical accounts are possible at all given the time factor and the fact that the footprints of a language used to be largely confined to the written, rather than the spoken, medium and as such offer no insight into what something may have sounded like). What\u2019s more, this problem is compounded by the fact that what comes down to us from the past was usually recorded (composed) by rich literate men (or clergymen who were again men), rather than (rich) literate women or illiterate poor (wo)men. \r\n It seems a natural necessity of all existing things to change, not for better or for worse, change happens for no obvious (or no psychologically, humanly understandable) reason. It simply seems that changes are part of a complex web that is still too complex for us to comprehend. This doesn\u2019t mean that one shouldn\u2019t approach change, it only means that no judgements should be passed on any one stage (of any structure of any language) being better or surpassing any other stage (of any language). This is why sciences are impartial, seemingly cold and aloof, but objective, non-judgemental and non-personal (pretty much like a Buddhist\u2019s view on the order of things). Think of biology or physics, for example: physics will never claim that a supernova is at a more advanced level than a red giant, nor will biology pass any judgements on the anatomy of a cockroach (as opposed to a swan, a willow warbler or a dolphin). Such statements would simply be laughable. The same principle holds in linguistics: we will observe, compare, analyse, establish orders of precedence of rules, but will never have anything to say about why something is better or worse than anything else we observe, because such statements are nonsensical in sciences.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2860, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9de12a1b-c0ff-4e5b-ab48-48c624adee87": {"__data__": {"id_": "9de12a1b-c0ff-4e5b-ab48-48c624adee87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2761, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7579c8f-6054-457f-93d2-cddcb1813dc9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-1.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2761, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "3934ad790096ba85de26786dc3eeed10ef33831cf5eabd2a9886e58195c97b20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1.2 What can history teach us? \r\nAs it turns out, everything is part of a larger structure, and as such has a history as well. You may have wondered why the human respiratory system is as imperfect as it is (note that this is not a scientific statement, but a human sentiment). Our lungs are only capable of performing a bi-tidal respiratory function. This means that we can at any one time either inhale or exhale, but not both, and the lungs can never be totally emptied of the inhaled air. This is similar to the movement of the seas: we either have an outgoing tide or an incoming tide but not both. Birds, in contrast, have a different take on the problem: their bodies have a system of interconnected airsacks in addition to lungs, which ensures that air can both exit and enter their bodies at the same time through different channels (their nostrils and mouths). This anatomical trait ensures that they have all the energy required for prolonged flying, which is both energy- and oxygen-consuming. \r\n But why are our lungs as they are? From a structural anatomical point of view little can be said about this, apart from describing this and drawing conclusions from this for the whole of the system (we may now understand why humans get tired very easily performing physically demanding exercises: the blood simply can\u2019t draw enough oxygen from the lungs, which as we see now can only work unidirectionally, first inhaling then exhaling thus losing precious time in drawing further supplies of air). But this is where a structural analysis stops.  \r\n      But what can we say about this anatomical \u2018flaw\u2019 from a historical point of view? If we examine fish we will see that fish have an air bladder that can be filled with oxygen from the blood, but this air bladder is part of the fish\u2019s digestive system. Human lungs, evolutionary biologists think, developed out of this air bladder of a distant ancestor, a bud on our digestive system. So, historically our lungs are closely associated with our stomachs, which explains why the air can only be inhaled and exhaled in one direction (air is basically food and food is normally only transported in one direction, away from the mouth into the stomach). As you can see, exhaling air can now be viewed as an evolutionary innovation (inhalation, just like passing food down our gullets, is older historically/evolutionary). \r\n      You may wonder which aspect of our analysis is more worth pursuing: the historical or the structural? There is no answer to this, both enrich in their own ways our understanding of our respiratory system. Which one you chose or prefer is down to you (this is a personal choice, not one based on scientific evaluation and as such cannot be discussed objectively).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2750, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d42c4dd4-dd6f-4f91-9679-dd715ffa5055": {"__data__": {"id_": "d42c4dd4-dd6f-4f91-9679-dd715ffa5055", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-10.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4460, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20a21db0-dcd3-4315-a4b5-27a4521d0948", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-10.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4460, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "1496322f0d712c93ab1e3f1f646abc3be944f25ac5b405a944e42d13d4147ad9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If you are still unconvinced, you probably want to ask how we know that words like anthem entered the language after the nasal loss rule? We know this from a number of sources: in Old English texts anthem, pansy and the like are never found. You may express your disbelief and say that perhaps exactly those texts are missing where these words would amply be found. There would appear to be no reason for this, however, given the fact that all words in (5a) are amply recorded in old texts. We don\u2019t see why Old English scribes would have left out exactly those words where there occurred a nasal before a fricative. What\u2019s more, we also know that words like pansy are of French origin (coming from Old French penser \u2018think\u2019) and these start appearing in the language well after the period we are discussing here. Words like lymph and nymph are of learned origin appearing in the age of enlightenment or later. All this seems to cement the fact that the nasal loss rule was a reality at some distant point in the history of English. \r\n       So, what do we have to show for all this? By comparing cognates,4 i.e., words that can be traced to a common origin, we can conclude (with some simplification) that English and German can be regarded as each other\u2019s \u2018sisters\u2019 pointing to a more distant common relative (a \u2018mother\u2019) in the past, a language from which both developed over the time. This proto-language is known as West Germanic. We can push our frontiers even further. If we compare English, German, Frisian, Dutch, Afrikaans with Danish, Swedish and the rest of the northern Germanic languages, we will see that there are further phonological regularities at work giving us a North-Western Germanic language family. Push it more and compare these languages with Gothic (an East Germanic language long extinct) and we will arrive at the Germanic language family. Confining ourselves to West-Germanic now we must answer the \r\n \r\nquestion of what the original words may have been that formed the basis from where the English and German words shown above have come down to us. We must conclude that in this proto-language they were very similar to what we have in German (see (6)). The forms are reconstructed in such a way that the English, German, Danish, Gothic developments that we have before us seem plausible (= natural, normally occurring in the languages of the world). If there ever was a common Germanic language, we predict it must have been something along the lines presented in (6) for the words discussed. \r\n(6) Proto-forms for (5) in Germanic and Indo-European West-Germanic  Indo-European \r\n*tan\u03b8 \t \t \t< *dent- (cf.

Where do we stop then? The last level of generalisation (the most abstract object of study in historical linguistics which still has something to do with English and can be arrived at using the comparative method shown here) is Indo-European, a language which we can only glimpse at through reconstructive work (a handful of the less controversial reconstructions are shown in (6)). Whether the forms reconstructed for this ancient language ever existed in the form in which they are reconstructed must remain a matter of philosophical speculation, analytical bias or a combination of the two.6 The drive to reconstruct Indo-European (and the ways in which this can be achieved) has resulted in thousands of books and analyses over the last 200 years. How far we can get back in time? Not too far. 4000-4500 years is where reconstructive analysis stops for one obvious reason: after this point all data become overly speculative. Claiming that Indo-European and Ugro-Finnic (a large language family that comprises Hungarian and Finnish) are related based on 5 vowels and 9 consonants is too weak: the five cardinal vowels i, e, a, o, u, voiceless stops, nasals, glides and a liquid are found in (almost) all languages and thus provide no incontestable proof of relatedness.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8, "end_char_idx": 4423, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82c4733b-9e26-4ef0-85ee-60aab32d3eb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "82c4733b-9e26-4ef0-85ee-60aab32d3eb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-11.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4642, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3965c104-bcb7-49c5-9f18-85f66a198f37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-11.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4642, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "dd1782d889e113bf845a7da19269a5234019d0b5ebee1456dfdfb7ddb0332641", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We have arrived at an important crossroads.

These are important cornerstones in any analysis. \r\n As you can see, by comparing words (phonological bodies of morphemes) that are cognates we arrive at a common proto-language provided that the two languages are related, of course. In historical linguistics the deeper we go in time, the less likely it is that words will be (superficially) similar. Actually, the more different the languages are, the more likely it is that they can be ultimately related through inheriting these words from a common mother language. It is important to understand that the notion \u2018the more different they are\u2019 means \u2018if the difference between two languages can be showed to regularly derive from the application of ordered phonological rules\u2019. Having two wildly different words is no proof of their relatedness. As we have seen, having two wildly similar words is no proof of relatedness either. This is a piece of wisdom that all historical linguists must take to heart at some point. Phonological variation between languages, as well as between accents of the same language, revolves around a phonological feature (or features) and a phonological position (coda, onset, etc.) and a phonological response to such a conditioning set of features and positions. \r\n The language \u2018gene\u2019 that underlies related languages can be understood as regular phonological change applying to an underlying representation. In historical linguistics not just any two languages can be compared, they must be genetically related through phonological changes revealing their common ancient ancestry through cognates. Of course, to know what can be compared, you must first do phonological comparison and discard what does not belong to your frame of comparison. This is why French and English are not immediately related and cannot be directly compared: there is no phonological rule that would reveal there was a common language from which these two developed through phonological change. English and French are ultimately related, but at the level of Germanic and Italic (of which French is a remote daughter through Latin), both of them descending from Indo-European. English and Hungarian are not immediately related, but not even ultimately; there is no genetic relatedness between the two. This is an important consequence of historical analysis. This, of course, doesn\u2019t mean that English and Hungarian cannot be compared typologically or through contact (areal) linguistics (we have seen that Hungarian has extensively borrowed from English, but for a historical linguist this is skin deep). \r\n Historical linguistics will ultimately come up with an understanding of what the Indo-European family of languages looks like (see below in (8) for a somewhat romantic representation including cats and birds and a gnarled tree for the cuteness effect).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4592, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "732e646e-9d31-46ff-8843-5d98e555640e": {"__data__": {"id_": "732e646e-9d31-46ff-8843-5d98e555640e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-12.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5178, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c182d2c-e475-4894-b07c-bb6d04ba9d06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-12.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5178, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "7307e8dfe5cac51be07da81b2b26491aa2bb143f47e5f0828c6712fc9daa46c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(8) The Indo-European language family \r\n \r\n3 \tLanguage vs dialect \r\nThe previous section has shown that in a historical analysis if you can set up phonological rules that trace the route a sound takes (in all the words in which it occurs in the same environment) through time allows you to say English and German are dialects of a now extinct language (West-Germanic). So, are English and German not languages, but rather dialects? The answer depends on your point of view. For a historical linguist a language is virtually the same as a dialect (of a now extinct dialect, which in turn may be the dialect of yet another extinct dialect, and so on ad infinitum). If you want to stick to the distinction between language and dialect, that distinction will mainly have to be established on a nonlinguistic basis. The basis will be routed in a social, cultural, military, naval or any other supremacy difference between the entities of which you want to elevate one to the status of an (official) language.  \r\n      In Germany, for example, there are several dialects (all with their own rules of grammar, including pronunciation), but there is southern German (centred originally around Bavaria), which used to be just another dialect until it was given official language status in the 19th century. This was done for practical reasons: a huge, unified country had to be run efficiently with a system of border-to-border law-making, effective administration, etc. Max Weinreich, a Yiddish scholar, said that \u201ca language is a dialect with an army and a navy,\u201d expressing very succinctly the fact how linguistically arbitrary this classification is (and how non-arbitrary it is from a power-based point of view). Once a country gains independence and/or takes power into its own hands, a language is suddenly born (Czech and Slovak are now popularly regarded to be two different languages, as are Serbian and Croatian, but for a historical linguist they are just dialects of an extinct language/dialect).  We must conclude that the difference between language and dialect is mainly political. \r\n      Yet, we have practical reasons to introduce another term, accent. It is used to describe dialects (languages) that have very similar (or identical) grammars and mainly differ in pronunciation, as is the case with Southern Standard British English (SSBE), General American (GA), South American English, and so on. As you can see English and German, or English and Russian are not referred to as two accents of the same language, because the differences (both phonological and non-phonological) are just too substantial for them to be regarded as the \u2018same language\u2019. SSBE and GA, however, can be referred to as accents of the same (rather abstract) language we call English. There is no \u2018one English\u2019, there are only various accents of it, or various \u2018Englishes\u2019. For a historical linguist, of course, all the various Englishes can be shown to have developed from one common source with the application of (a rather long series of) phonological rules (or at least this is how it can be envisaged linguistically). All Englishes are historically related to each other though through common origin, leading back to West Germanic. \r\n      We have worked our way through a substantial amount of information to realise that change has always been a central notion in the description of languages. The languages we see today are full of changes happening just now, which means that we are witnesses to how new accents (and given considerable time, even dialects; and given even more time and space, languages) may develop. What we see today as variations existing among the speakers of the various Englishes may one day become a differentiating feature (as is the case with R-loss which can be used for the differentiation between rhotic and non-rhotic accent, discussed later). This comes as no surprise because there are no two instances of the same word said in the same manner (just observe how your own pronunciation varies from moment to moment in your own language, or English for that matter). Some changes are minor, some may appear more substantial. The question of which of these changes will ultimately become a differentiating feature of one accent as opposed to another is anyone\u2019s guess. Linguistics can predict which direction a change may take based on what we have observed in the world\u2019s languages, but whether it really will go down a certain path cannot be predicted with certainty. Some changes will become entrenched in one language but not in another, and so on. But as you can see, languages do change (as all things generally do), are changing at the moment, and have changed in the past as well (just read our discussion on English and German and the rest of the Indo-European languages). \r\n3.1 How can you picture an ongoing change? \r\nIt may appear simplified but just imagine someone throws a pebble into the peaceful mirror of a lake.

We will have 6 of these characteristics to discuss briefly. Before we go there, it is worth asking what words we are using as our point of departure. Maps that show isoglosses always start with the comparison of cognates (= words that were \u2018born together\u2019 or found together in a now extinct language; go back to our discussion if you don\u2019t understand this), not words that are viewed to have entered the language separately (i.e., independently of a common mother language). So, maps like the ones below will be based on words like bath and sun (two words that have been in the language since Germanic times), course (a word that entered English from French at least 500 years ago, before it branched off into GA or SSBE), but not banana, basil, sushi, sachet, gateau, jalapeno, quesadilla, chinchilla, chihuahua or the like that are viewed as relatively recent borrowings that have entered GA and SSBE separately on separate occasions (more on this below). This is crucial: words referred to above like bath, sun and course did not enter GA and SSBE separately on separate occasions, these words were present together (= they are cognates) in an earlier mother language from which both GA and SSBE develop.  \r\n      Note the difference between GA and SSBE basil: b\u025bjz\u0259l in the former, baz\u0259l in the latter. The differences in pronunciation cannot be explained by assuming that these words come from a common source (= a mother language). There is no way for accounting for the differences between the two vowels using the phonological rules we are familiar with from historical phonological analysis. We have to conclude that basil entered GA and SSBE separately (= the word didn\u2019t exist in the mother language from which both GA and SSBE developed), and as such cannot be used to establish isoglosses. If, however, an accent of GA (let us call it GA2 spoken in the Rockies) ultimately came to develop a rule that changed every \u025bj to aj, we would say that basil could then be used for an isogloss differentiating between GA1 and GA2. Why? Because both GA1 basil (with \u025bj) and GA2 basil (with aj) come from a common mother language/dialect (GA). As you can see, we have just applied the same historical principle to a hypothetical example. It seems that historical analysis and dialectology are the heads and tails of the same linguistic coin. \r\n4.2 Major variables used in the classification of English accents in the UK \r\n\u2022 R-dropping \r\n\u2022 H-dropping \r\n\u2022 FOOT-STRUT split \r\n\u2022 NG-coalescence (phoneme-hood of \u014b) \r\n\u2022 FACE-GOAT diphtongisation \r\n\u2022 BATH-TRAP split \r\nYou must be aware that the isoglosses shown below will also depend on whether a speaker comes from a rural or an urban area, on their family background and the education they received.

After the loss of the velar voiced stop, \u014b became a phoneme (its presence is now unpredictable and it now distinguishes words, as in sing \u2013 sin \u2013 sim). The read pocket area shows where the velar nasal is still only found before g, but not on its own. \r\n(14) NG-coalescence", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 791, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdc22cc7-4579-45cc-a56f-ad54bbae91ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdc22cc7-4579-45cc-a56f-ad54bbae91ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-18.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 765, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79bffca1-1c4a-4e5c-a6f1-9a1aa30eb34d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-18.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 765, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "34f84c86ecc101c056eb59efa6e81c7e8013d9407bced13ee57070e54426fe37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4.2.5 \tFACE-GOAT diphthonging \r\nThis feature refers to whether the accent in question has the diphthongs \u025bj (having historically come down from e\u026a) and \u0259w (from o\u028a) or whether it still has the long monophthongs e\u02d0 and o\u02d0 instead.

Analysing a language can happen at two independent, but complementary levels. One deals with structure: the system of contrastive building blocks (features like voice, nasality, place of articulation, manner of articulation), phonemes, contrasts, syllables (and whether they exist), stress (and whether any generalisations can be drawn on them based on the various patterns we encounter), intonation (and whether the various contours can be used contrastively and how this can be described). This approach you have been engrossed in up to now is synchronic linguistics (ancient Greek syn- \u2018together, next to\u2019 and chron- \u2018time\u2019, referring to units of analysis present at the same level of reference/slice of time, say 19th century English, or contemporary South African English), on a par with anatomy (no questions asked about where our lungs come from, only their function can be inspected and how they fit into the larger unit that we call the organism). This approach may have its limitations, but then the synchronic approach can never be aware of its own shortcomings because it doesn\u2019t have the means to assess its own limitations. You are now aware why we say that \u025bj (as in pane) and \u025b\u02d0 (as in pair) are two phonemes of this language, but you don\u2019t know anything about whether this has always been the case or not. This is not a problem, you may not want to consider this a problem, or you may have other reasons to dismiss history, the fact remains that all analysts doing synchronic linguistics have to live with absence of history in a synchronic analysis. \r\n The complementary approach is called diachronic linguistics (Greek dia- \u2018across\u2019 and chron- \u2018time\u2019), referring to a point of view when items are inspected as they developed from each other, not as they coexisted with other units of analysis at the respective point of reference/slice of time. Historical linguistics will tell you after some deliberation that (some instances of) \u025b\u02d0 derive from \u025bj, so \u025b\u02d0 is an innovation. If you dig deeper you will realise that even \u025bj is an innovation, deriving from e\u02d0. Dig deeper still and you will see that (some instances of) e\u02d0 derive from a\u02d0 (pane having originally been pa\u02d0n). And who knows what further linguistic excavations will produce. Similar chains of developments can be established for the rest of the phonemes of the language. This is a mental exercise which requires considerable expertise and knowledge of the past stages of English, languages in general, spelling conventions of the past (and their limitations), comparison of languages (English with German, English with French or any other combination), comparison of dialects (and accents) of English (SSBE with GA, Scottish Standard English or any other variety for that matter). The analysis ultimately produces a complex network of chains of developments (see (1) below which only contains one part of a more extensive summary) with instances of mergers and splits (to be explained later)).

At some point in the history of the language there appeared a phonological change that lengthened every *a before a voiceless fricative that was either word-final of followed by a consonant (= fricative in coda position), see (19a) in Accent 2. If the fricative was followed by a vowel (= fricative in onset) in the same word (but not across a #-boundary as in pass#ing), the lengthening failed, as in (19b(i)) (compare class \u0251\u02d0 to classify a). Lengthening also failed if the short vowel was followed by any other consonant (19b(ii)). We can blame this on a rule shown in (20). In Accent 1 nothing happened. \r\n(20) BATH-lengthening a   a\u02d0 / __ Fric(\u2212voi)#,  __Fric(\u2212voi)C (voiceless fricatives: f \u03b8 s \u0283 \r\n,303 \r\n) \r\nThe rule produced a segment (a\u02d0) that was an allophone of short a in Accent 2. This can be regarded as phonetic lengthening, something that stayed invisible to phonology (the language did not acquire a new phoneme as its occurrence was predictable, as shown by (20)). To complicate matters somewhat, it seems that this long a\u02d0 developed into two qualitatively different vowels, a\u02d0 and \u0251\u02d0 (there was no change affecting the short vowel, which stayed an open low short a) in the accents we show as 2.1 and 2.2 above. This qualitative change also remained invisible to phonology, a new phoneme did not come into existence.  \r\n      However, there was another change underway that we will discuss at length later: R-deletion, which did result in a new phoneme being added to the system (cat kat vs cart k\u0251\u02d0t). Now there suddenly arose a minimal pair: the difference between cat and cart now hinged only on the difference in the two vowels.  \r\n      The distribution of a and \u0251\u02d0 before voiceless fricatives, however, was still predictable at this stage (before coda fricatives there was a long low vowel, before onset fricatives it was a short low vowel). In other words, the existing phonemic opposition between short and long A was neutralised before coda fricatives (the vowel here could only be long: class) and before onset fricatives as well (the vowel here could only be short: classify). (You may remember other neutralisations in the language as well: s and \u0283 are two phonemes of the language (sin vs shin), but before r only \u0283 can occur (shrew, but not **srew), which allows us to say that the phonemic difference between s and \u0283 before r is neutralised into \u0283.) \r\n We have a bit of a conundrum here: how did the split happen? Why do we feel that this once allophonic/predictable difference between the vowels differentiates words now? It seems that what used to be complementary distribution at one stage ceased to be complementary at another due to analogy based on alternations involving the two vowels. The word class, for example, had two alternants: one with a short A (classify a) and one with a long A (class \u0251\u02d0). It seems that complementary distribution ceased by the transference of the short vowel into the position which was originally occupied by the long vowel (mass a \u2018quantity of matter\u2019 now has a short vowel instead of a long one, influenced by massive a that has always had a short vowel). The same happened to math, which was influenced by mathematical.7 You see now that pass(#ing/#ed/#er/#able) \u0251\u02d0 \u2013 passenger a \u2013 passive a - passion a (all containing the same stem) preserve the original distinction (and distribution). There is no explanation as to why pass has not been influenced by passenger. This is a choice that this accent made at some point (a choice which may be reversed in the future). \r\n Not everything can be explained so neatly. The words mass \u2018holy service\u2019 and Basque can have both a long and short vowel (= free variation). Words like lass, bass \u2018perch\u2019, ass \u2018donkey\u2019, lash have short vowels, while ass \u2018backside\u2019 usually has a long vowel, as does moustache. The same is true for words in which the fricative was followed by a consonant: ask, task, mask, cask, rascal have long vowels, mascot, asp, Bafta have short ones.  One possible explanation is that these words were \r\n\u2018reborrowed\u2019 from those accents in which the BATH-lengthening never happened (the non-SouthEastern accents). Bafta, of course, is too modern a word to be reborrowed. Here we must conclude that the rule of BATH-lengthening is dead as a rule, it ran its course and is no longer active.

We will not investigate this here. Another very likely possibility is that some of these words are learned or recent borrowings, coming into the language after BATHlengthening had run its course (remember a similar example in connection with anthem). The rule, when it was active, and the processes of analogy and reborrowing that followed have resulted in an arbitrary (lexical) distribution of a/\u0251\u02d0 (= you have to remember which word in this particular category has which vowel). What used to be allophonic variation before voiceless fricatives is now a phonemic fact. We will see further examples for this as we proceed. \r\n The term split may appear slightly misleading because although this is a split in the pronunciation of the original vowel, the path to the appropriate vowel in modern English is unpredictable at the present stage of the language. Split must be understood as phonemic (\u2018unexplained\u2019) split. If you find a word which ends in -ast, -ask, -asp, the quality of the vowel is unpredictable (it has to be remembered; it is a lexical matter of the word in question). Note, however, the following: while phonological analogy may have replaced a long vowel (\u0251\u02d0) with a short one (a) in words having a voiceless fricative in constant coda position (clasp \u0251\u02d0 vs asp a) or in words in which the voiceless fricative was either in onset or in coda position in the same morpheme depending on alternation (mass \r\n\u2018weight\u2019 now with a short vowel, influenced by massive where the vowel was always short, as opposed to pass, which kept the long vowel), the long vowel has not been analogically extended to alternants with the fricative in onset position (passive and massive with a, but never \u0251\u02d0).  \r\n      Words that have either never had a fricative in coda position (hat, map, lag have never had a long vowel and they have been kept that way) are really our control group where nothing interesting happens. There is thus order in analogical madness: the long vowel has thus not been extended to words in which the voiceless fricative has always been in onset: passive, passion, mathematical have never been recorded with \u0251\u02d0. Of course, for words that exemplified no alternations (e.g., cassock, lacerate) we have no reason to suppose that a long vowel could ever have spread to them.

This R may have undergone deletion (in non-rhotic accents), but is still present in rhotic accents. As you know by now, English spelling is very conservative and preserves such (now non-existent) R\u2019s (e.g., art). Some of these R\u2019s are non-recoverable (e.g., art), but word-final R\u2019s are recoverable (e.g., This car is automatic). Of course, in rhotic accents every historical R is still present. Let us first look at the environments where R can be found today. We will be referring to pronounced rhotics as r (this may be a historical or linking R in non-rhotic accents, but may also be intrusive r, a rhotic that was inserted into words at some point after Middle English). Let\u2019s look at (22) now. \r\n(22) Environments of r \r\n \r\nIf you analyse (22) you will see that the only position where r is stable is the word-initial position (either before a stressed vowel (V\uf027) or an unstressed vowel (v)). Note also that semi-rhotic accents (like EastCoast/New England old-fashioned American) show that the word-final position is stronger than wordinternal coda position: in the former r can still be found (tar), but not in the latter (art). It seems we also have a hierarchy of strength for r-deletion: if r is lost word-internally before an unstressed vowel (era), it means it will be lost in all the other positions as well, and so on, according to the strength hierarchy of positions: rat > era > tar > art.  It also follows that we don\u2019t expect to find accents in which the r is retained in art, but not in tar. \r\n      In SSBE r must be followed by either a vowel or a syllabic consonant to be pronounced (see the Chapter on syllables in this course). In the history of SSBE there occurred a change that deleted wordfinal pre-pausal r (This is made of tar) and pre-consonantal r (I like art). This seems a rather straightforward process, you would think. It is and it isn\u2019t because the loss of the rhotic is bound up with at least two other processes, Broadening and Breaking. Before we go any further, we must ask whether word-final R in SSBE is historical (or linking) R or intrusive r. \r\n5.2 Linking R or r? \r\nBefore we go any further, we must ask whether word-final R in SSBE is historical (or linking) R or intrusive r. The apparently obvious answer is that it is R, that is a historical R, which has been around from Middle English times. This R is, it seems, a r which has never been deleted because it was shielded off from deletion by the vowel-initial word after it (see (22)). \r\n(22) R or r?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2678, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1d4e8d0-ebae-4ef2-bd26-05588c21e527": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1d4e8d0-ebae-4ef2-bd26-05588c21e527", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-26.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1890, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6bde57d-2fdd-43a5-907b-a831a070ae50", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-26.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1890, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "b6b9d3404081538495a2cf9f7f6ec72c60b610e0575da9ebed82183992844d94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Reality, however, is more interesting than fiction because we have a number of reasons to believe that this R is actually not R (the historical R), but r (a \u2018new\u2019 rhotic inserted by a rule after Middle English). \r\nLet\u2019s look at why we should think that the r at the end of car is not R. \r\n5.2.1 \tReason 1 for claiming r is not R in car \r\nThe loss of R after a stressed vowel results in compensatory lengthening, i.e., the lengthening of the vowel after which there used to be an R in word-internal coda position (see (23)).

This is because of a rule (set out in (29)) that took over the regularity of the pronunciation of word-final pre-vocalic r. The rhotic r is automatically inserted by a rule after long vowels and schwa of SSBE. For this reason, these vowels are known as R vowels. \r\n(29) r-insertion rule \r\n0 0 r / V\u02d0# __ V (V\u02d0 = R-vowels: long monophthongs and schwa) \r\nLet us review what we have come to see so far (see (30)). (30) Conclusions \r\n \r\nIt seems then that in a non-rhotic accent there is no historical R word-finally. As a matter of fact, it seems historical (lexical) R is only found word-initially (e.g., rat) and word-internally before a vowel \r\n(e.g., carrot, hurry). Word-internal coda R is lost for ever (e.g., art), it is unrecoverable, but word-final R is an automatically inserted, post-lexical r. Phonetically, however, there is no difference between lexical R and post-lexically inserted r, both are r (a pronounced rhotic of identical qualities). \r\nPhonologically, historical R is not inserted by any rule, post-lexical r is. \r\n5.3 Distribution of vowels before r \r\nUp to now we have seen where r can be found in the various accents of English, and have also concluded that all word-final pre-vocalic r\u2019s are post-lexical (inserted by a rule). This is not where the story ends, because r also exercised a considerable impact on the vowels preceding it in some of the accents in the past. \r\n5.3.1 \tScottish Standard English (SSE) \r\nLet\u2019s look now at Scottish Standard English (SSE) first.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2081, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d4c5688-52f9-4f18-9f87-ce7df5f6af90": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d4c5688-52f9-4f18-9f87-ce7df5f6af90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-28.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-28.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1815, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "185b3460-7182-454a-bec0-b98b85027b71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-28.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-28.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1815, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "e825630e53b4a1d98e147a96834092342884718d8be735fcdeb6c36f14747610", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(31) Scottish Standard English pre-r vowels \r\n \r\n(31) has all the possible environments where r can be found (preconsonantal and word-final, as well as before pre-vocalic r in mono-morphemic words). The control group contains vowels before consonants other than the rhotic (first column). SSE has tense and lax vowels. They differ in quality with the tense vowels (i, e, u, o) being generally higher than their lax counterparts (\u026a, \u025b, \u028a, \u0254). This is a relative notion (just compare the pairs on a vowel chart). The vowel a behaves phonologically (= distribution-wise) like a tense vowel: it can occur word-finally (e.g., spa), similarly to any other tense vowel. Schwa cannot be found stressed word-finally (this is a historical accident), but it can be found unstressed word-finally, just like any other tense vowel (Ch\u00edna \u0259, similarly to l\u00e1tte late). (Recall that in CuBE schwa is also odd because it patterns phonologically with the long R-vowels.) \r\n      As you can see, in SSE r has had no influence on the preceding vowels. Pre-r vowels are no different to non-pre-r vowels. This may be because in SSE r is qualitatively different to both General American (GA) and SSBE r. In SSE the rhotic is more consonantal, and less vowel-like in pronunciation. Phonetically, it is a rolled r very different to the one found in GA and SSBE. We will not go into phonetics here, but compare it another major accent of English, GA. Note, however, that there is no lax \u028a before a coda R (this is due to a historical rule: \u028a > \u0259; note incidentally that SSE also has the FOOT-STRUT split).

Before coda R the historical short non-low vowels all merged into schwa (spirt = serf = burn = hurt \u2260 tar \u2260 port).  Before onset R lax vowels keep their quality just as they do before any other consonant (spirit = spit, serif = set, bull = Buryat, hut = hurry). The only vowel that mergers differently is historical short a, which is found as \u025b before onset R (tarry \u2260 tar).  \r\n      Note also a change independent of R in GA: lax \u0254 is generally only possible before coda R (port, board), not before any other consonant, including onset R. So, words like lot, cot, shot, lorry, porridge, hot, because, dog all have \u0251 in GA (where SSBE would normally have \u0254). It is only dialectally (especially in East Coast/New England American) that lax \u0254 is found before voiceless fricatives (as in cloth, loss, lost) and before onset R (as in porridge and oral), and also in some other positions (call, thought, daunt, law). In GA these all have \u0251. Historically, the vowel in pot (\u0251) is a new development in GA (it used to be \u0254), as compared to \u0254 in port, and porridge (where R acted as a protective environment, preventing it from becoming \u0251 in New England American). Note that spelling is very conservative: pot still has the lax \u2018o\u2019 vowel that it did historically. However, not even in GA does the \u2018once tense\u2019 \u0254 become \u0251 before onset R (oral, story, etc. still have \u0254), see summary in (35b) where the shaded areas show identical vowels in GA and conservative New England English. \r\n The traditional name for the combined effects of the first nurse merger and the backing of the historical a vowel before coda r (tar) are known as pre-R broadening (compare tap vs tar, set vs serf, sit vs spirt, to which we can add hut/burn where the change was vacuous). Pre-R broadening is also extended to the failure of \u0254 becoming \u0251 before coda R (port \u0254, never \u0251). So, first nurse merger + laxing of a to \u0251 + failure of \u0254 to become \u0251 before coda R = pre-R broadening. \r\n      Note a further effect that onset R has had on lax a and \u025b, as well as tense e before it: all of these have merged into lax \u025b, so marry merry Mary have the same stressed vowel in GA (as opposed to SSBE where we have different vowels: m[a]rry m[\u025b]rry M[\u025b\u02d0]ry). Let\u2019s call it the MARRY MERRY MARY merger (36). As a conclusion we can say that the 11 non-diphthongal vowels before C (\u2260 r) reduces in number to 6 before r (see (37a)). But do we ever have a diphthong before r? The answer is yes. The wide diphthongs can still be found before the rhotic (see (37b)). As you can see, GA has no diphthongs other than the wide diphthongs.

The vowel mergers discussed above didn\u2019t happen in one fell swoop. There were a number of rounds of mergers. In very conservative (possibly no longer existing) American English story, porridge and pot had three different vowels at one stage: story o, porridge \u0254 and pot \u0251. It seems the merger first affected the tense vowel before onset R making story \u0254 and porridge \u0254 have identical lax vowels. The lax \u2018o\u2019 that was not followed by R lowered to \u0251 (pot). In modern GA those lax \u2018o\u2019s that originate in historical lax \u2018o\u2019s can in some accents lower to \u0251 (e.g., porridge, lorry, sorry with \u0251), but those that originate in the tense \u2018o\u2019 do not (e.g., story, notorious seem only to have \u0254, not \u0251). Perhaps this distinction is reinforced by spelling. The same distinction once existed in Mary e vs merry \u025b vs marry a. Today Mary and merry have a merged lax vowel (\u025b) in GA (but may still have the original distinction is some accents), and marry has either \u025b or a (in some accents of GA). The marry merry Mary merger is not yet complete, as you can see. However, compare this to mare, rare, fair which can only have \u025b (not the historical e). Coda R was a stronger cause of mergers than onset R. As you can see, all this variation on the same theme may be a point of difference for a number of American accents and may ultimately lead to new languages in the (very distant) future. \r\nNote also that word-final \u0251 in GA which has an origin independent of the rhotic (law, spa) patterns with the tense vowels (it can be found word-finally, for example ), but there is another \u0251 (the one originating in pre-R broadening, as in car, cart) which is found before the rhotic and patterns with the lax vowels (see (37a)). We have both a tense \u0251 and a lax \u0251, it seems. Note also that a (as in pat) which cannot be found word-finally and as such patterns with the lax vowels, but it cannot be found before r where one would only expect lax vowels (given the overall laxing effect or the rhotic).

CuBE, and SSBE in general, has diphthongs instead of tense vowels that we saw in SSE and GA (observe the __C environment). Diphthongs historically come from tense vowels. \r\n      What happens if historically lax (short) vowels are followed by coda R? Here the modern vowels are long and there is no coda R (spirt, serf, tar, port, burn). This is because of R-dropping (see (48 below), and the chapter on syllables in this course). However, coda R did not only drop (with compensatory lengthening), it also affected the quality of the preceding lax vowel in a process we have already discussed for GA (first nurse merging) plus backing of a to \u0251, and raising of \u0254 to o. All these changes can collectively be referred to as pre-R broadening. This change is shared by SSBE and GA, which for a historical linguist means that American English and SSBE are closely related. As always, languages introduce new rules. SSBE, starting in the 18th century, started applying a rule known as Rdropping. After R was dropped, the vowels underwent compensatory lengthening, resulting in long broad vowels (as opposed to GA, where there was no R-dropping and hence the lax vowels are still short, and followed by R, of course). This is why SSBE and GA are still very closely related, but by no means identical. It also follows that if R was not dropped, the vowel is expected to be short. We\u2019ll see if this is borne out by the data. \r\n      It also seems that no diphthongs are possible before R (and r). In BrE R-vowels (= the long monophthongs) can only rarely be motivated synchronically by r. Look at some of the facts in (39). \r\n(39) Vowels and R in BrE \r\n \r\nIt seems when R is not pronounced, the vowel before it lengthens. The opposite also holds: if the R is pronounced, the vowel is short.

The examples in (40) show that we can find a long vowel even before those Rs that have never been lost. In monomorphemic Charon the long vowel must be due to another reason. \r\n We have seen that historical word-internal coda Rs were lost in BrE: words like card, lord, serf contain unrecoverable Rs. There is no possibility of ever recovering them. We have also seen that before such Rs stressed vowels are long (card, lord, serf). However, it seems vowel length doesn\u2019t entirely depend on R loss: words like Charon have long vowels despite absence of R loss. So, this can\u2019t be the whole story. See (41) for where r is found. \r\n(41) Environments where r is found \r\n \r\nIt seems that BrE has acquired its R vowels from two sources. There are native sources and some of the long vowels have arrived with loanwords from other languages. We will see how non-native sources of vowels can rearrange the phonological environment in which a sound can be found. This will be a good example for areal linguistic influence having a go at rearranging the phonological system of a language. English. of course, will remain a Germanic language from a historical linguistic point of view, as long as it holds onto its core Germanic vocabulary.

This happens when a historical diphthong (or a tense vowel in other words) was followed by r (see (43)). (43) Breaking of diphthongs before r \r\n \r\nIf you consider the data above, you will see that diphthongs could be followed by r in the past (this is not generally true for modern BrE). The data is brackets show sporadic data (the diphthong oj is only found before R in two words: Moir, and its alternative form Moira). Let\u2019s see in detail what happened (see (44)). \r\n(44) Schwa-insertion before coda R \r\n \r\nThe first step was the insertion of \u0259 between the glides (j and w) and coda r (see (44)), shown in red. Why was schwa inserted? It seems it had something to do with sonority. The glides are more sonorous than r (see further examples in the chapter on diphthongs in this course). There appeared a constraint that prevented the glides from being followed by r. This appears to have been the opposite of syncopation. This \u2018anti-syncopation\u2019 effect was responsible for a profound change that was now set off. Before we continue, observe what happened before onset r. Here schwa was optionally inserted (see \r\n(45)). \r\n(45) Optional schwa insertion before onset r \r\n \r\nThe picture is slightly more complicated because schwa was obligatory before diphthongs \u025bj and ow (see (46)). \r\n(46) Obligatory insertion of schwa before onset r \r\n \r\nWe will see how this restriction will play out in what lay in the future for these sequences. Note also that sometime in the 20th century another change affected the diphthongs ow and uw when these were not followed by r (see (47)). \r\n(47) Fronting of the diphthongs ow and uw when not followed by r \r\n \r\nAfter schwa insertion a new constraint came into existence in Southern BrE: non-syllabic r could only be pronounced before vowels and syllabic consonants (as in red, carrot, barrel, barren, terrorist; for details see chapter on syllables). Before consonants and word-finally, non-syllabic r was lost (see (10), repeated as (48) below; note that this is historical R, which was r when it was still pronounced). This is how coda R was lost in Southern BrE. \r\n(48) R-dropping r R \u00d8  / __#, __C \r\nR-dropping was followed by smoothing (= intervocalic glide loss and lengthening of vowel). Let\u2019s see how this played out over the system (see (49)). (49) Smoothing after R-dropping \r\n \r\nIn current Southern BrE (CuBE) smoothing is only obligatory for \u025bj\u0259 and ow\u0259, which are always monophthongs (\u025b\u02d0 and o\u02d0). For the rest of the vowels, all three possible pronunciations exist side by side, they are in free variation. It has to be admitted though that the monophthongised pronunciations are becoming the norm (although we have sound recordings to prove that monophthongal pronunciations were certainly around even more than 50 years ago). \r\n Let\u2019s see what happened before onset R (recall that onset R was not lost in Southern BrE). Before onset R schwa insertion was only obligatory after \u025bj and ow. This is borne out by the data (see \r\n(50)). \r\n(50) Smoothing before onset R \r\n \r\nAs you can see, where schwa insertion was optional, both pronunciations exist side by side in CuBE. As expected, where schwa insertion was obligatory, only the smoothed version exist (Charon, oral). One offshoot of this is that there are no historical \u025bjr and owr/\u0259wr sequences in CuBE (*\u025bjr, *owr/*\u0259wr). \r\n Let\u2019s see if smoothing is still an active process in CuBE. We still have data that show that smoothing is affecting even those words that have never contained an R.

There is thus a split of \u0289\u02d0 into two vowels depending on the place of articulation of the preceding consonant: if the consonant before it is non-palatal, \u0289\u02d0 can optionally lower to o\u02d0 (poor with either \u0289\u02d0 or o\u02d0, as opposed to pure with \u0289\u02d0, o\u02d0 or \u0259\u02d0, read more on this in the chapter on diphthongs and the problems surrounding them). \r\n Another change we have to discuss is syncopation (the loss of an inter-consonantal schwa when followed by an unstressed vowel), see (52).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1273, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f14bf8e-ac3a-4629-a4ce-2e0054d82f72": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f14bf8e-ac3a-4629-a4ce-2e0054d82f72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-37.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 982, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae3219bc-d4d3-4e8e-8019-da3965acb646", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-37.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 982, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "abafeef24ac7c972ede46f3a68e454b557a435e7ca4a592b594d558807293968", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(52) Syncopation \r\n \r\nNote that in Ireland and ironing the schwa is secondary (= inserted in the process of breaking).

Look (53) where we have collected all the possible environments where checked (short) vowels and R-vowels can occur.

The Queen is very modern and innovative (at least from this perspective).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 1374, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bf2ab8f-9937-409c-abb6-fc4e6ffac34d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bf2ab8f-9937-409c-abb6-fc4e6ffac34d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-4.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-4.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5620, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba13bc81-4d68-4ea4-a916-eda616cd49be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-4.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-4.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5620, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "0b82bb1ec18e9aebec9bb3b5307857a46f19fedb433bd5e4ed0763ef49e11386", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2 \tWhat can be compared? \r\n2.1 Types of approaches to data in linguistics \r\nIn one word, anything can be compared along a chosen axis: syntactic features of language A with syntactic feature of language B; semantic changes can be compared; phonological processes can also be compared (diphthongisation, monophthongisation, weakening of consonants, vowel reduction, etc.). The subject of comparison gives a perspective and helps to organise linguistic material into occurring, rare or impossible patterns. Let us see some of these approaches. \r\n Typological linguistics usually analyses syntactic and morphological similarities. For example, it looks at whether languages have prepositions (like English, French, Croatian: e.g., in the school, sur la maison \u2018on the house\u2019, u kutiji \u2018in the box\u2019) or postpositions (like Hungarian: iskol\u00e1ban, h\u00e1zon, dobozban). It may also look at how morphological material is organised with respect to the base of the word: some languages have long complex words built up of a sequence of affixes centred around a syntactically independent semantic core and are thus word-based, like Hungarian, Finnish or Turkish: \r\ne.g., HU megm\u00e9rettet\u00e9seidben \u2018in your (singular) allowing yourself to be tested for what you can do (plural)\u2019 with the ultimate stem m\u00e9r \u2018measure, test\u2019, which is also an independently occurring word.1 Some languages are stem-based (affixes are added to a syntactically non-independent core, as it is done in Latin, Greek or the Slavonic languages. For example, the stem behind the word for earth in Latin terra is terr-, something which can never be found on its own/in isolation (that\u2019s why you will find a hyphen after such data): terr- is thus abstracted away from terra, terrae, terr\u0101, terram, terrarium, terras and the rest of the shapes that this stem can take on. Hungarian and Latin thus belong to two different types of languages as far as morpheme independence is concerned. Both Hungarian and Latin, however, are referred to as synthetic languages (they synthesise a number of morphemes into long words). They contrast sharply with Chinese, which is an analytic language where there is little or no inflection (so there are no complex/synthetically inflected words). No language is perfect from any perspective, of course: Hungarian has bound stems (in j\u00e1t\u00e9k \u2018toy\u2019 and j\u00e1tszik \u2018to play\u2019 there is a bound stem j\u00e1t-), and Chinese has compound words (and thus its derivational morphology is not analytic). English is more analytic than Hungarian, but its inflection still shows signs of synthesising (boys boy+Plural is still a synthetically formed word, just like begs beg+3 person+singular+present+indicative). The derivational morphology of English can still be argued to be heavily synthetic. \r\n      It may also analyse how passivisation is executed: morphologically, syntactically or lexically. Of course, no language will ever be a perfect example of just one type of process. Languages will always be scattered on a cline of features. Hungarian, for example, can express the logico-semantic concept of possibility by either using a suffix (e.g. tanul-hat \u2018can study\u2019, literally study-can) or a syntactically independent word/auxiliary (tud tanulni or b\u00edr tanulni), similarly to English (can study), although the  two languages are generally taken to belong to two different morphological types of languages. Note that in a typological analysis any language can be compared with any other. \r\n As is well-known, languages may develop similar features because they are spoken in close proximity to each other and speakers have a chance of mixing through marriage, trade, shared pastures, etc. Areal linguistics looks at how features may spread from one to language to the other. It is generally claimed that Hungarian has developed a complex system of verbal prefixation through extended contact with languages such as German and Russian (e.g., csin\u00e1lni \u2018to do\u2019 vs meg-csin\u00e1lni \u2018to have done it\u2019, kicsin\u00e1lni \u2018to have aggravated somebody\u2019, be-csin\u00e1lni \u2018to have been scared stiff\u2019, fel-csin\u00e1lni \u2018to have put her up the duff\u2019, etc.). We are not saying here that the verbal prefixes meg- or le- are of German or Russian origin, of course. The lexical material is Hungarian, the principle is non-Hungarian originally (= express perfectivity with prefixes, not with auxiliaries or different tenses). Some claim that bilingual speakers are the key in understanding these similarities because it\u2019s only through such speakers that aspects of any language can be internalised in another. This aspect of language contact can be observed at any level (phonology, morphology, syntax, and probably most visibly in the lexicon, etc.). \r\nHungarian may have developed the use of prefixes to cover an area for what it originally used \r\ndifferent tenses, but it doesn\u2019t mean that its use of prefixes (or their distribution) will be identical to that in German or the Slavonic languages. In Hungarian prefixes are usually very mobile (they can appear separated from the verb to which they attach: meg fogja \u0151 ezt m\u00e9g biztos csin\u00e1lni \u2018he will still do this surely\u2019 where meg- has been separated from its verbal host csin\u00e1l over a long stretch of words). This mobility is unheard of in Croatian and Serbian, for example, some of those languages from where perfective prefixation may have spread into Hungarian: Uraditi \u0107e on to jo\u0161 sigurno \u2018he will still do this surely\u2019 where the prefix u- always stays glued to its verbal host raditi \u2018do\u2019 irrespectively of the syntactic environment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 5529, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e25b4a55-1af1-4ec1-9cc7-d74a0f4ff44e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e25b4a55-1af1-4ec1-9cc7-d74a0f4ff44e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-40.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 555, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c11aff64-4f39-46f8-afd0-a818103322f1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\Arthur\\Desktop\\Helsinki studies\\24-25 Thesis\\PhonAnal\\Simulated_questions-answers_experiment\\experiments_with_oracle\\raw_texts_split_manually\\settext-9-40.txt", "file_name": "settext-9-40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 555, "creation_date": "2025-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-29"}, "hash": "ba69df8f50aa70a7b686b7b14317de0fb0495b959e60d384585887f5f154b066", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "5.5 A diachronic view of the origin of vowel contrasts \r\nLet\u2019s look at the set of contrasts that all of these developments produce.

What\u2019s more, it is not only native phonological sources that produce a new set of contrast, but loans can also result in a new set of oppositions. CuBE can be characterised as having massive (historical) mergers. To this can be added a new set of mergers that involve the vocalisation of dark-L (ball > o\u02d0 < bore, full, bull > \u0289w < foo, boo, mull > \u0259w < mow, etc., read on this in the Chapter on diphthongs). \r\n In Middle English short/lax vowels were possible before coda R (barn, corn, burn all contained short vowels), in CuBE this is no longer possible (for the very simple reason that R-dropping was introduced after Middle English). Before onset R, Middle English lax vowels have come to us mostly unchanged (carrot, ferry, burrow, mirror, lorry) because if R was not dropped, there was no compensatory lengthening. This was informally known as the \u2018carrot-rule\u2019. However, recent loans like tiara, harem, Sahara have introduced long \u0251\u02d0 exactly where this was previously impossible (in the \u2018carrot environment\u2019). An opposition between short and long vowels was born. Other sources have conspired to introduce the rest of the long vowels before onset R: breaking (and associated changes), and the monophthongisation of \u0251w (notorious, Taurus) introduced o\u02d0 before onset R. The \u2018carrot-rule\u2019 which was never really a rule, just a descriptive tool, is thus long dead.

Note that in GA door can only have \u0254, but poor can be either \u028a or \u0254. This is because there was a (now invisible) split: some words (like door and course) that originally contained \u0289w split off and joined those words that had ow (like boar). This is why they can only have o\u02d0 in CuBE, and \u0254 in GA. Words like poor stuck to their historical \u0289w, and have o\u02d0 (or \u028a\u0259 in conservative) SSBE/CuBE,10 and \u028a in GA (although poor can also be p\u0254r pointing to a similar split in American, or rather more interestingly to a more ancient split in what used to be a common British-American English before one branch split off into American). \r\n Still for the specialists: note that SSBE shares the wide diphthongs (\u0251j oj aw) with all other accents of English (including GA and SSE, of course). The rest of its diphthongs originate in early Modern English tense vowels that underwent diphthongisation, see (59) for a summary.

This, of course, is not an all-inclusive list of differences between the three accents. \r\n For some of the extreme specialists: the diphthongisation of the tense vowels referred to above actually happened in two steps: first the Mid Vowel Diphthongisation (of e and o), or MVD, then the High Vowel Diphthongisation (of i u), or HVD. MVD is responsible for the accentual differences between Southern and Northern English (referred to as FACE GOAT Diphthonging). We can also see that MVD is historically older than HVD because its results are categorical. This is why \u025bj and \u0259w can never be followed by r in SSBE (care, Mary, more, notorious), as opposed to \u026aj and uw which can (optionally) if the following R is in onset position (serious \u026ajr, lurid uwr). This free variation shows that HVD is historically more recent than MVD.

Of course, for a speaker of English this has no bearing on their knowledge of the language. A little bit of French or Latin has never resulted in any child not being able to master the language if it was exposed to it with the help of its environment. The example in (4) is English in its full glory (and not French or Latin or Greek). Areal linguistics will tell you that English has acquired (= \u2018borrowed\u2019) an immense amount of lexical items from a number of languages close by or further away (French being just one of these). The language has also acquired a substantial amount of words from Latin and Greek not through language contact but learned borrowing (with the help of sciences that looked to Latin or Greek for vocabulary). All this has shaped English into what we can observe today. As you can see, areal linguistics will be able to compare any language with any other provided it has had an impact on the language you analyse.

Linguistics also claims that English and German are genetically related, that is at some \u2018deep\u2019 level they are more closely related (= similar) to each other than English and French are (despite the casual remark that these two share a substantial amount of their lexical items and must thus be related). This is because English and German are Germanic languages. French is similar to Italian, Spanish, Catalan or Rumanian (and the rest of the Romance languages). It is also common knowledge in linguistic circles that the Romance and the Germanic languages are also similar to each other (at an even \u2018deeper\u2019 level), and so on and so forth until the final circle of comparison is made to the effect that English and French and Latin and Greek and Sanskrit and Russian and Persian (Farsi) and Armenian and Albanian (and a fair deal of others) are all more similar to each other than they are to any other language outside this circle (like Hungarian, Finnish, Turkish, Basque or Chinese). What we have now done is give an insight into what perspectives comparing languages from a genealogical perspective may open up. This is the territory of historical (or diachronic) linguistics. From what we have said so far it should be obvious that perceived similarities between words themselves are no guarantee that any two languages will be more closely related to each other than they are to any other where the casual observer sees no similarities. Claiming that Hungarian and English are \u2018genetically\u2019 related because of the similarities in words is simply missing the point big time. \r\n Diachronic linguistics is not commonly referred to as genealogical linguistics because strictly speaking it does not deal with genes (genes being the repositories of inherited information from a biological perspective). Languages are above and beyond genes in the traditional biological sense, so any child with any genetic (racial) background can learn any language whatsoever (a Caucasoid learns Russian just as easily as an Australoid). It also seems that any child with any genetic makeup can acquire any number of unrelated languages making them a bilingual or a multilingual child. From what we have said it follows that, in a diachronic analysis, languages cannot just be analysed indiscriminately (a typological or areal analysis allows for any two languages to be compared at any level (syntactic, morphological, lexical), as shown above). It would appear that relatedness between languages is more than skin deep, but how can it be accessed if it is difficult to spot and interpret? And even more importantly is it syntax or morphology or phonology perhaps that opens up a window on this level of relatedness?3  \r\n2.2 The language \u2018gene\u2019 as understood in diachronic linguistics \r\nBased on our short discussion in 2.1 morphology and syntax are not reliable indicators of relatedness either. Hungarian has verbal prefixes, but it is unrelated to German or Russian. English uses auxiliaries just like Hungarian (he can study = \u0151 tud tanulni), but this doesn\u2019t place it in the group of languages from which Hungarian comes down, and so on. \r\n The basis for any diachronic analysis as it has been understood for more than 200 years now is phonology. We have concluded, however, that words themselves offer no indication of relatedness. We have to modify this to the following effect: where superficial phonetic similarities end there may begin a diachronic phonological analysis. It is not words that are relevant for a historical analysis, but the relationship (and the relative temporal depth) between phonological changes affecting such words. \r\nHungarian csetel \u2018chat\u2019 and English chat is \u2018boring\u2019 diachronically and superficial and as such is no proof for these two being related.

To be able to ascertain what happened here the analyst must be able to form generalisations along the if this i then that / _under this and that condition_ continuum; after all, one wants to demonstrate that when we have this in English, we expect to find that in German under this and that condition. So what are these components? As far as the set of limited data in (5a) shows English seems to have no nasals when these are followed by a voiceless fricative. German seems to have pre-fricative nasals, but seems to lack \u03b8 (for which it has d, as in Zahnd). Some words have lost this final d (Zahn). English has long vowels (more precisely diphthongs) today in five, goos and tooth (but not in soft, dust and us). Old English has long monophthnogs. These details are missed by the casual observer. \r\n What do we make of all this? Is this haphazard? The answer must be in the negative. We can propose that at some time in its history English developed a tendency for deleting its nasals before a voiceless fricative. Phonologically this can be explained as the loss of a non-continuant (= stop) nasal before a continuant (here fricative) sound. After the loss of the nasals, their positions did not disappear, however. Through a process of compensatory lengthening the vowels before these now-lost nasals were lengthened. If the nasals were followed by another non-continuant (= stop), they were preserved (see examples in (5b)). This explains half the data for English in (5a), as measured against (5b). \r\n      What about those words that have a short vowel nowadays? If our analysis is any good, we will have to provide (or at least attempt) an explanation for this. In us the vowel is short because in this language function words have no lexical stress (but may acquire it at sentence level) and may also lose contrastive length (that is, they may end up with a lexical short vowel, which doesn\u2019t alternate with a long one, not even if it is stressed emphatically). This is what happened here: us used to have a long vowel (for which we have textual evidence from Old and Middle English: in Old English it was \u016bs, in Middle English ous with <ou> showing a long vowel, similarly to <ou> in house). In modern English us has a short vowel, both when it is unstressed (\u0259s) and emphatically stressed (\u0259s\uf027 ), see Chapter on intonation on this. We must say that we have no evidence for us containing a long vowel in modern English (at some point the word lost its long vowel and was relexicalised with a short vowel). \r\n      In soft we can invoke a phonotactic constraint: in English, only short vowels can be found before a non-coronal consonant cluster, which is still true today (\u014fctopus, l\u012dmp, tr\u016dmp, \u014fptical, \u0103mber, etc.) with very few counterexamples (ch\u0101mber, C\u0101mbridge, s\u0113\u012bsmograph, tr\u0103ipse, etc.).

We have seen in this course, however, that sC clusters are unpredictable (you may remember that it is a lexical property of any given word how a sC is syllabified: Nebraska is Nebr\u00e1s$ka, but \u00f3rchestra is \u00f3rche$stra as shown by stress assignment, see Chapter on stress). We have to conclude that the same applies to the length of vowels before st clusters: the vowel is either long or short; in dust it happens to be short today, although it could be long as well; there is no phonotactic restriction on the length of the vowel). Note that in Old English the vowel was indeed long (d\u016bst), as expected, showing that dust was re-lexicalised with a short vowel after Old English. After all, there is nothing phonologically at odds with a long vowel (or diphthong) before a coronal sC-cluster (oust, post, Geist, etc.). \r\n      There are other observations as well: German lost \u03b8 and has now \uf064. This is true for every German word, as every \u03b8 was regularly displaced by \uf064 (cf. think, as opposed to denken; that, as opposed to das, etc.). Note also that German has no mb clusters: it has <mm> m now. This is true for every historical *mb in German (compare En lamb to G Lamm going back to *lamb-, comb to G Kamm going back to *kamb-; timber to G Zimmer \u2018room\u2019). Note that an asterisk (*) shows reconstructed data in historical linguistics, NOT ungrammatical data. Double asterisks (**) show ungrammatical data. \r\n      A few important questions must be asked and answered. Which language is more conservative, i.e. closer to the original state of affairs? It is German, but why? Why can\u2019t we say that German decided to insert nasals before its fricatives at some point? Because in historical linguistics inserting something is \u2018more expensive\u2019 than deleting something, meaning that every insertion must be very carefully weighed (= motivated/explained) against the conditioning environment. There is nothing that motivates the insertion of nasal before fricatives. There are hundreds of words where there is no nasal before the fricative (schaffen \u2018make\u2019, **schamfen, lesen \u2018read\u2019, **lensen, etc.). There also are words with a fricative in this position (uns \u2018use\u2019, f\u00fcnf, Kunst \u2018art\u2019, etc.). It seems that German has no problems with nasals before fricatives. Deletion of the nasals in English has been motivated as the loss of a noncontinuant nasal before a continuant fricative, which seems to be a natural and recurrent process in other languages as well (in Hungarian, n is lost before all continuants, including the fricatives: honfi \u2018patriot\u2019 with a long, nasalised vowel \u0254\u02d0\u0303 .  \r\n      There is an important consequence of this analysis. If the loss of nasals before fricatives is what characterises English, and if rules are understood as they should; that is, as rules applying to all possible inputs at a given time, there should be no nasals before fricatives in English at all. This is not borne out by the data: nymph, lymph, anthem, Kensington, pansy, lens, and the list continues. Is this the end of our analysis? Fortunately, this is not the case. We must conclude that rules (or rather their lifecycles) are fickle: they appear and they disappear for no obvious reason. Everything is born, it lasts for a limited time and then dies. The same applies to rules. The nasal loss rule above operated a long time ago (over almost 1500 years ago). We must conclude that all those words that we gave as counterexamples are not a problem, because they arrived (well) after the nasal loss rule had run its course. Historical linguistics is replete with such cases: words surviving rules not because they were stronger in any imaginable way than the rules but because they arrived (= were borrowed) later than the rule(s) for which they are supposed counterexamples.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8, "end_char_idx": 3986, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",
