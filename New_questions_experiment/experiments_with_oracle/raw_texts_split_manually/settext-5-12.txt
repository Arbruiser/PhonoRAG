The speaker may consider some part of his sentence as “old” information, known both to him and the listener. If this old information is at the end of the sentence, the speaker will de-stress the words which express it, and move the tonic leftwards to the (end of the) “new” information. In such cases there is no contrast or emphasis involved; the tonic-bearing word is not opposed to anything, it is just highlighted as new. 
 In the examples below the old information is printed in italics; the DISLOCATED TONIC which highlights the (last stress of the) new information, is capitalized: 
 
 	(Was the headmaster angry about it?) — I ′didn’t  SPEAK to the headmaster. 
 	(We only serve Indian food here.) — I  WANT Indian. 
 	(My wife comes from Singapore.) — Oh, I ′grew  UP in Singapore! 
Sometimes the fact that the information is “old” (= “given”) is only obvious from the situation or from the hearer’s knowledge of the general background: 
 	 	′Here’s the CCD I promised to bring you. 
 	 	(Leeds is a very busy town.) — I know, my  PARENTS live there. 
 
Anaphoric words de-stressed for old information 
The speaker may, alternatively, choose to express the old information with unstressed content-words, usually synonyms or other words which refer to the things mentioned: 
 	(Why’s that man looking at you?) — I ′went to  SCHOOL with the guy. 
 	(Everyone was talking Chinese to me,) but I ′don’t  SPEAK the language. 
 	(Joe ran away) be′fore I could  ASK the idiot. 
 
In all these cases the tonic counts as dislocated because it is not on the last content word.
