
4.2.5 	FACE-GOAT diphthonging 
This feature refers to whether the accent in question has the diphthongs ɛj (having historically come down from eɪ) and əw (from oʊ) or whether it still has the long monophthongs eː and oː instead. This characteristic is also known as mid vowel diphthonging referring to a historical diphthongisation that affected the long mid vowels *eː  and *oː (goat and face having originally been goːt and feːs in those areas where these words now have diphthongs). Of course, in those areas where the FACE-GOAT diphthonging has never taken place, face and goat have always had the long monophthongs oː and eː (these accents are thus less innovative, or rather more conservative, compared to CuBE).
