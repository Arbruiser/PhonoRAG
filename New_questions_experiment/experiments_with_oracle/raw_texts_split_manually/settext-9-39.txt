This comparison of the three major accents of English shows how conservative the reference accents are. The more diachronic rules you have, the more innovative the accent. It seems that SSBE is the most innovative, SSE the most conservative, while GA is more innovative than SSE, but less so than SSBE. 
A similar (yet far more elaborate) chart can be drawn up for, let’s say, English and German, or English and Ancient Greek that would show which language is conservative (and from which aspect). As you can see, the fact that two languages don’t happen to sound similar (or fairly similar) is no reason to discard the possibility of them being related at some (ancient) level. We can now answer the linguistic question of who is more conservative: The Queen or President Trump. It’s most certainly President Trump because he doesn’t have R-dropping, compensatory lengthening, breaking or smoothing. The Queen is very modern and innovative (at least from this perspective).
