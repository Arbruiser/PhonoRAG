A compound is a lexical unit (a lexeme) made up of two or more free stems (= words), e.g. gréenhouse, to ill-tréat, car ferry, unemployment benefit. Compounds usually have a specialized meaning: a bláckbird is a special type of bird, not any bird that is black. Compounds behave as units from the point of view of grammar (syntactically) and meaning (semantically).  
 	From a phonological point of view there are two types of compound:  
 	 initially-stressed compounds, pattern  #  1  #  3  # 
 	 	primary stress on the first element: gréenhouse, cár ferry, compúter virus 
 	 finally-stressed compounds, pattern #  2  #  1  # 
  primary stress on the second element: trade únion, fruit sálad, Victoria Státion The type depends on the syntactic relationship between the two elements, their frequency, or degree of lexicalization. The meaning or communicative “importance” of the elements is not decisive. 
 The spelling of compounds in English is not consistent. Some are written as one word (gréenhouse), some with a hyphen (wòrd-fínal), but the majority are written as two words (cár ferry, geógraphy teacher, dòuble chín). The latter may be called “invisible compounds”, since the spelling does not show that they are compounds.2 
 When two words are just an ordinary phrase (new book) and not a compound, both elements are stressed, the second has the primary stress according to the End-Weight Principle. Observe the examples, where (a) and (b) have the same stress pattern, while (b) and (c) are compounds: 
 	a. (We are using a) néw bóok.  
– phrase; finally-stressed by End-Weight Princ. 
 	b. (I’ll make some) fruit sálad. 
– compound, finally-stressed 
 	c. (We drove to the) cár ferry.  
– compound, initially-stressed
