	“nonlow”	ij	əw	uw	unstressable
	“nonhigh”	ej	aj aw	oj	not unstressable
If we do not accept it as a mere accident that the first element in the free vowels occurring unstressed is the same three checked vowels that occur unstressed, then the simplest explanation is that these are, in fact, the same three vowels, [i], [ə], and [u], followed by a consonant, [j] and [w]. But there are further arguments for this analysis.
   In light of the unstressability scale of (7), HAPPY-tensing is a suspicious phenomenon. Why should an unstressed light syllable become heavy? The vowel in an unstressed syllable is expected to become “simpler”, shorter, closer, but not longer or a diphthong. I argue that HAPPYtensing is not the fortition of a vowel, rather it is the consequence of the generalization of a phonotactic constraint of English.
   In the interpretation advocated in this paper, the input of this change is [i] and the output is [ij]. This change is the “fortition” of the vowel, only if [ij] is a diphthong, that is, a single unit. If, however, it is the short vowel, [i], followed by a consonant, [j], then this change is the epenthesis of a consonant. Word finally this consonant is epenthesized because word-final short vowels are dispreferred in English. Prevocalically, this consonant is epenthesized because prevocalic vowels (that is, hiatus) are also strongly dispreferred in English.
   We have seen that stressed short vowels do not occur either word finally or prevocalically. In the accent described by Jones and Gimson, the unstressed short vowels [i] and [u] could occur in these positions: happy [hapi], India [ındiə], value [valju], jaguar [dʒaɡjuə], and unstressed [ə] can occur word finally, but not prevocalically. The constraint against short vowels in word-final and prevocalic position has been generalized to unstressed position, which triggers the insertion (or, in the case of [uw], the retention) of the glide after these two short unstressed vowels. Most importantly, in neither case does this change make the syllable heavy, which would entail that it is less unstressable. It is well-known that word-final consonants are not moraic in English, so the glide does not add to the weight of the final syllable in the changes from [hapi] to [hapij] or [valju] to [valjuw]. The glide that appears between two vowels, as in the changes from [ındiə] to [ındijə] or [dʒaɡjuə] to [dʒaɡjuwə], is an onset, hence it does not contribute to weight either. That is, the unstressed syllables involved in HAPPY-tensing and VALUE-tensing remain light, hence fully unstressable.
   The appearance of a [j] and [w] after [i] and [u] in unstressed word-final and prevocalic position is thus the result of the extension of the constraint against short vowels in these positions. However, only if we analyse these two glides as consonants will they not contribute to the weight of the unstressed syllables they seem to appear in.
