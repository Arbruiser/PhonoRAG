The effects of the End-Weight Principle are well known in the analysis of word stress: – if a word has two (rarely three) stresses, the last must be the primary, the one(s) before it secondary. Consequently, there cannot be a secondary after the primary. 1
– strong-unstressed syllables (fórmat /-mæt/, diréct /daɪ-/) are also called “tertiarystressed” because their vowel does not reduce (as it would in completely unstressed syllables like sálad /-ləd/ or Óxford /-fəd/). From the prosodic point of view, however, 3ry and zero stresses do not count as stresses because the End-Weight Principle does not “see” them: they can never become 1ry-stressed.  
We conclude that in prosody there are only two phonologically relevant stress degrees: 
stressed (1ry or 2ry) and unstressed (3ry or zero).

We shall occasionally mention (and indicate) secondary stress, but generally we shall just speak of stressed and unstressed syllables – or, more simply, stressed and unstressed words (meaning that their primary-stressable syllable is stressed or unstressed).
