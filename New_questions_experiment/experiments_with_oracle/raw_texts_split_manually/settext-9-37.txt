
(52) Syncopation 
 
Note that in Ireland and ironing the schwa is secondary (= inserted in the process of breaking). This schwa can be syncopated. As a matter of fact, there is free variation here: some speakers syncopate the schwa (and thus undo breaking) or keep the schwa and have smoothing (the result of which is a ‘smooth’ pronunciation of the triphthongal sequence ɑjə as ɑː (or ɑə). In (50) we said that in word like clearance, curious, firing, fiery, sowerest, towering there is optional breaking (= schwa is only optionally inserted). We now see that the absence of schwa can be explained with syncopation (klɪjərəns > klɪjrəns due to syncopation). 
      In words like diamond and violence, there is an original/historical schwa (one which is not due to breaking), which is syncopated before an unstressed vowel. As you can see, Ireland behaves like diamond (some speakers have syncopation, some apply smoothing to the triphthongal sequence ɑjə).
