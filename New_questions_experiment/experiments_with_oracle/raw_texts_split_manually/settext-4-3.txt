A diphthong is the combination of a vowel and an adjacent glide (or, perhaps schwa) into what is considered as one unit. What kind of unit this is is not clear: it is usually not a segment in the autosegmental sense, since it consists of two skeletal slots with melody associated to each. The literature also mentions so-called light (monomoraic) diphthongs, which are monosegmental (linked to a single skeletal slot, Kaye 1989, 128), but their status is even less clear. Whether a vowelþglide or glideþvowel sequence is a diphthong is a question that phonetics cannot answer, this is a matter of phonological analysis, and accordingly this is a language-specific issue. It may well happen that a vowelþglide or glideþvowel sequence is a diphthong in some variety of a language, but not in another variety.
   It can even be argued that the status of a glideþvowel sequence may differ from word to word. With respect to article selection, the French word [jatys] ‘hiatus’, for example, behaves as a vowelinitial word: it selects the vowelless form of the singular definite article, [ljatys], which is typical of words that begin with a vowel. The beginning of the word [jauʁt] ‘yoghurt’ is rather similar, yet it selects the vowelful form of the singular definite article, like consonant-initial words do: [ləjauʁt]. Digging a bit deeper, we find some facts that may make us wary. On the one hand, [jatys] has an alternative form [iatys], which begins with a “real” vowel, but [jauʁt] does not have such an alternative form. Yet [wat] ‘watt’ selects the vowelful singular definite article [ləwat], while [wat] ‘cotton’ may also select the vowelless allomorph, [lwat], although the latter word has no vowel-initial variant, p[uat]. On the other hand, there exist numerous French words that begin with a “real” vowel, and yet select the preconsonantal, vowelful variant of the singular definite article: for example, [ɛn] ‘hatred’, [laɛn]. Many (though not all) of these words have a [h]-initial etymon: [ɛn], for example, is a descendant of the same Proto-Germanic word as English hate, which did indeed begin with a consonant.
   English is less variable in this respect. Vowel-initial words select the consonantful variant of the indefinite article (an apple), consonant-initial words select the consonantless variant (a pear). This distribution holds even in words that are variable: we have a hen for speakers who pronounce hen as [hen], but an hen for those who pronounce it as [en].
   With its phonetically stable article selection, English provides us with a criterion for analysing “diphthongs” that begin with the glide. Words like yak or wax cannot begin with a diphthong, because they do not behave like vowel-initial words: pan yak, pan wax figure. In fact, no glideþvowel sequence can be analysed as a diphthong in English: even words that were historically vowel initial behave as (5 are) consonant initial today when they begin with a glide (e.g., a ewe, a eulogy, a unit, a Uyghur). That is, the article test neatly distinguishes consonantand vowel-initial words in English, and uniformly categorizes glides with consonants and, consequently, glideþvowel sequences as clusters, not diphthongs.
