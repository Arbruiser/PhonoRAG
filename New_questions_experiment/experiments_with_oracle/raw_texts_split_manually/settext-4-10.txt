Alternations of vowels are very common in unstressed position in English. The tendency is for both [i] and [u] to become [ə]. The alternations in (11) serve as examples.

Alternations in unstressed position



a.	chicken [tʃıkin] ∼ [tʃıkən]
b.
stimulus [stımjuləs] ∼ [stımjələs]

purchase [pəːtʃis] ∼ [pəːtʃəs]

accurate [akjurət] ∼ [akjərət]

event [ivent] ∼ [əvent]

conjugal [kondʒuɡəl] ∼ [kondʒəɡəl]
element  [eləmənt] deputy [depjutij] ∼ [depjətij] amulet [amjulit] amjulət] amulet [amjulət] ∼ [amjələt] While many instances of unstressed [i] and [u] alternate with [ə], certain word-final consonants block this alternation, they “protect” the quality of the preceding vowel. Examples are provided in (12).
(12)	No alternation in unstressed position
a.	polish [poliʃ]	b.	vacuum [vakjuwəm] ∼ [vakjuwm] ∼ [vakjum] ostrich [ostritʃ]	volume [voljuwm]	oljum] manage [manidʒ]
attic [atik]
Danzig [dansiɡ] viking [vajkis]
Unstressed [i] is stable before word-final palatal and velar consonants. Unstressed [u] is stable before the word-final labial consonant [m], but it does not occur before other labial consonants, [p], [b], [f], or [v]. The coronal [n], for example, does not inhibit the preceding unstressed vowel vowel ending up as schwa: fortune [foːtʃuwn] ∼ [foːtʃən].
   If unstressed [ij] and [uw] are [i] and [u] followed by the glides [j] and [w], respectively, as argued here, their stability follows from the palatal and labial consonant following the unstressed vowel.
