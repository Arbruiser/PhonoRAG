In fact, there is a sixth member of this set: GOAT. Jones claims that [ou] has an allophone [o] “in certain unstressed positions” (1917, xxxv). This vowel is represented by [ou], the italicized offglide is “optional”. It is most common before a consonant, especially at the end of what looks like a learned prefix, but elsewhere too: both positions are exemplified by automobile [ˈɔːtoumoubiːl]. We also find this symbol before a vowel (Genoa [ˈdʒenouə]). Interestingly, the word-final occurrence of this alternation is rather rare, Jones indicates it in fellow, but not arrow, borrow, hallow, window unless followed by a vowel-initial suffix or in a compound: fellow [ˈfelou] vs. arrow [ˈærou] vs. arrowy [ˈæroui], arrow-head [ˈærouhed].
   British English underwent a vowel change that is relevant from our point of view, GOATfronting (or advancement, Wells 1982, 237). The shift of the first part of earlier [ou] into [əu] is already mentioned by Jones (1917), but it is given graphical recognition only much later by Gimson (1962), as [əʊ], and Jones (1967), as [əu]. With this change, the marginal reduced vowel [o], which was in free variation with [ə], has disappeared from dictionaries. It has been replaced by the canonical reduced vowel, [ə].
   As a result, in current British English we have six reduced vowels. Three of the six checked vowels may occur in unstressed position: KIT ([i]), STRUT ([ə]), and FOOT ([u]); and three free vowels may also occur here: FLEECE ([ij]), GOAT ([əw]), and GOOSE ([uw]).
   None of the R vowels, that is, the long monophthongs, may occur unstressed. This follows from universal tendencies of stressability. For example, Hayes claims that “CV counts as a light syllable. It is probable that long-vowelled syllables universally count as heavy; [... b]ut CVC syllables vary: in some languages they are heavy, in others light” (1995, 120). Accordingly, we can set up the stressability scale in (6), where “>” means the item on the left is more stressable than the one on the right.
(6) The stressability scale
VV$ > VC$ > V$
All the vowels in the inventory I posit in (3) may be stressed (this is because schwa is claimed here to be equivalent to STRUT, cf. Fabricius 2007; Szigetvari 2018), but only a subset of them may be unstressed. Because of this, what we need is the opposite of the stressability scale, that is, an “unstressability” scale. This is given in (7).
(7) The unstressability scale
V$ > VC$ > VV$
The scale shows that the R vowels (VV) are the least unstressable vowels, and indeed, in English they only occur stressed. We have mentioned above that free vowelþschwa sequences alternate with R vowels. However, this only occurs in stressed position, so idea may be [ajdıː], but India may not be p[ındiː], secure may be [sikjuː], but jaguar may not be p[dʒaɡjuː]. This follows from the nonoccurrence of long vowels in unstressed position.
   But its quantity is not the only factor that determines the unstressability of a vowel. Not all checked vowels and not all free vowels may occur unstressed. Let us first look at the six checked vowels. They may be arranged in the format shown in (8).
