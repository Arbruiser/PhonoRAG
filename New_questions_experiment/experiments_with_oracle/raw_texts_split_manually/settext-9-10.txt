We know this from a number of sources: in Old English texts anthem, pansy and the like are never found. You may express your disbelief and say that perhaps exactly those texts are missing where these words would amply be found. There would appear to be no reason for this, however, given the fact that all words in (5a) are amply recorded in old texts. We don’t see why Old English scribes would have left out exactly those words where there occurred a nasal before a fricative. What’s more, we also know that words like pansy are of French origin (coming from Old French penser ‘think’) and these start appearing in the language well after the period we are discussing here. Words like lymph and nymph are of learned origin appearing in the age of enlightenment or later. All this seems to cement the fact that the nasal loss rule was a reality at some distant point in the history of English. 
       So, what do we have to show for all this? By comparing cognates,4 i.e., words that can be traced to a common origin, we can conclude (with some simplification) that English and German can be regarded as each other’s ‘sisters’ pointing to a more distant common relative (a ‘mother’) in the past, a language from which both developed over the time. This proto-language is known as West Germanic. We can push our frontiers even further. If we compare English, German, Frisian, Dutch, Afrikaans with Danish, Swedish and the rest of the northern Germanic languages, we will see that there are further phonological regularities at work giving us a North-Western Germanic language family. Push it more and compare these languages with Gothic (an East Germanic language long extinct) and we will arrive at the Germanic language family. Confining ourselves to West-Germanic now we must answer the 
 
question of what the original words may have been that formed the basis from where the English and German words shown above have come down to us. We must conclude that in this proto-language they were very similar to what we have in German (see (6)). The forms are reconstructed in such a way that the English, German, Danish, Gothic developments that we have before us seem plausible (= natural, normally occurring in the languages of the world). If there ever was a common Germanic language, we predict it must have been something along the lines presented in (6) for the words discussed. 
(6) Proto-forms for (5) in Germanic and Indo-European West-Germanic  Indo-European 
*tanθ 	 	 	< *dent- (cf. Latin dent- ‘tooth’) 
*samft  	 	(seems to have been confined to the Germanic languages) 
*uns 	 	 	< *nes (cf. Latin nos ‘we’, Russian nas ‘us’) 
*fimf  	 	< *penkw(t)- (cf. Serbian pet, Greek pend-, Punjabi Pañj,5 etc) 
*gans  	 	< *ghans- (cf. Latin (h)anser, Greek khēn, Russian gusa) 
Take a deep breath and compare the Germanic languages to the Slavonic languages and so on and on and on until phonological analysis lets you look behind the data to arrive at ever more ancient protolanguages. Where do we stop then? The last level of generalisation (the most abstract object of study in historical linguistics which still has something to do with English and can be arrived at using the comparative method shown here) is Indo-European, a language which we can only glimpse at through reconstructive work (a handful of the less controversial reconstructions are shown in (6)). Whether the forms reconstructed for this ancient language ever existed in the form in which they are reconstructed must remain a matter of philosophical speculation, analytical bias or a combination of the two.6 The drive to reconstruct Indo-European (and the ways in which this can be achieved) has resulted in thousands of books and analyses over the last 200 years. How far we can get back in time? Not too far. 4000-4500 years is where reconstructive analysis stops for one obvious reason: after this point all data become overly speculative. Claiming that Indo-European and Ugro-Finnic (a large language family that comprises Hungarian and Finnish) are related based on 5 vowels and 9 consonants is too weak: the five cardinal vowels i, e, a, o, u, voiceless stops, nasals, glides and a liquid are found in (almost) all languages and thus provide no incontestable proof of relatedness.
