The table above is not easy to digest, but you can now see how many processes can conspire to produce the modern set of oppositions in vowels in CuBE. What’s more, it is not only native phonological sources that produce a new set of contrast, but loans can also result in a new set of oppositions. CuBE can be characterised as having massive (historical) mergers. To this can be added a new set of mergers that involve the vocalisation of dark-L (ball > oː < bore, full, bull > ʉw < foo, boo, mull > əw < mow, etc., read on this in the Chapter on diphthongs). 
 In Middle English short/lax vowels were possible before coda R (barn, corn, burn all contained short vowels), in CuBE this is no longer possible (for the very simple reason that R-dropping was introduced after Middle English). Before onset R, Middle English lax vowels have come to us mostly unchanged (carrot, ferry, burrow, mirror, lorry) because if R was not dropped, there was no compensatory lengthening. This was informally known as the ‘carrot-rule’. However, recent loans like tiara, harem, Sahara have introduced long ɑː exactly where this was previously impossible (in the ‘carrot environment’). An opposition between short and long vowels was born. Other sources have conspired to introduce the rest of the long vowels before onset R: breaking (and associated changes), and the monophthongisation of ɑw (notorious, Taurus) introduced oː before onset R. The ‘carrot-rule’ which was never really a rule, just a descriptive tool, is thus long dead. We have seen that rules are born, they operate and then die out allowing for new oppositions to develop. Areas once ‘controlled’ by rules are reinterpreted by oppositions arriving from newly borrowed words. The table above shows that in CuBE the quality of vowels before r, or any other consonant for that matter, is unpredictable phonologically (bad a vs bard ɑː, cod ɔ vs cord oː, tiara ɑː vs carrot a, etc.) although spelling is of help (given its extreme conservatism). Note also how impossible it is to guess the spelling from the phonetic input: poː comes from three different historical sources: *ɑw (as in paw), *ʉw via breaking (and associated changes, as in pour and poor) or *ow via breaking (and associated changes, as in pore). 

 For the hard-core specialists: interestingly, for some words there is still free variation: poor can either have oː or ʉə/ʊə (for older speakers), but door can only be oː (for both younger and older speakers). Note that in GA door can only have ɔ, but poor can be either ʊ or ɔ. This is because there was a (now invisible) split: some words (like door and course) that originally contained ʉw split off and joined those words that had ow (like boar). This is why they can only have oː in CuBE, and ɔ in GA. Words like poor stuck to their historical ʉw, and have oː (or ʊə in conservative) SSBE/CuBE,10 and ʊ in GA (although poor can also be pɔr pointing to a similar split in American, or rather more interestingly to a more ancient split in what used to be a common British-American English before one branch split off into American). 
 Still for the specialists: note that SSBE shares the wide diphthongs (ɑj oj aw) with all other accents of English (including GA and SSE, of course). The rest of its diphthongs originate in early Modern English tense vowels that underwent diphthongisation, see (59) for a summary. We can also say that the diphthongisation rule fed the rule of breaking (it provided additional environments where it could now word). This is a very nice example for where and how accents can begin to differ: in the rules they choose to add to their rule component of phonology.
