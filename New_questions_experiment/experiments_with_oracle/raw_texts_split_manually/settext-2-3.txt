The terms “voiceless” and “voiced” are in quotation marks in the previous paragraph. Although we can use them to refer to the English phonemes we transcribe as /p, t, k; f, θ, s, ʃ, h; ʧ/ and /b, d, g; v, ð, z, ʒ; ʤ/, respectively, it must have become clear by now that these are phonetically inaccurate or insufficient descriptions: the members of the former set are indeed voiceless, but what may distinguish the plosives in this category is not only the stable voicelessness but also aspiration; as for the members of the latter category, it is not true that their primary characteristic is that they are voiced—they are voiced only in a given context. Therefore, we can use the terms “fortis” and “lenis” to refer to these obstruent series. For further details, please read “Fortis vs. lenis”11 in Phonolec notes. 
      We can distinguish two types of laryngeal system (= language) based on how the laryngeal opposition between their two obstruent series is realized. Languages like Hungarian, including Romance languages (e.g., Italian, Spanish and French) and Slavic languages (e.g., Ukrainian, Czech and Serbo-Croatian), contrast negative VOT and zero (short-lag) VOT, i.e., voiced unaspirated and voiceless unaspirated plosives. They are called (true) voicing languages. In English and most Germanic languages (e.g., German, Icelandic and Norwegian) or Mandarin Chinese, the contrast is between zero (short-lag) and positive (long-lag) VOT, i.e., they have voiceless unaspirated and voiceless aspirated plosives. They are referred to as aspirating languages.
