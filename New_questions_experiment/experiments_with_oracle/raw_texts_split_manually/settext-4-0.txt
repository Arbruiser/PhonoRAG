Numerous descriptions of the vowel systems of different Englishes have been proposed during the past centuries. Most of these descriptions include a group of vowels that are analysed as diphthongs. This group comprises several sets that are variably seen as diphthongs or as monophthongs. These sets are shown in (1).
(1)	Sets of vowels potentially categorized as diphthongs in English
a. PRICE, MOUTH, CHOICE
b. FACE, GOAT
c. FLEECE, GOOSE
d. NEAR, SQUARE, FORCE, CURE
Practically all accounts of English take the vowels in (1a) to be diphthongs. Accounts of British English count the vowels in (1b) to be diphthongs too, those of American English are varied (diphthongs in Chomsky & Halle 1968; monophthongs in Kenyon & Knott 1953 or Giegerich 1992). Sweet (1900) transcribes FLEECE and GOOSE as [flijs] and [guws], it is only Jones (1917) who (wrongly, as I will argue) alters the British tradition, and introduces the currently prevalent monophthongal symbols [iː] and [uː] for the vowels in (1c). American accounts again vary, the typical case is to lump the vowels in (1b) and (1c) together, either as diphthongs ([ey], [ow]; [iy], [uw]) or as (tense) monophthongs ([e], [o]; [i], [u], respectively). The vowels of the last group, (1d), are vowelþ[r] sequences in rhotic American English, occasionally centring diphthongs. In British English they were diphthongs at the beginning of the last century, but have all gradually monophthongized. This is reflected in the transcription of FORCE by Jones (1917): [fɔːs] (vs. Sweet’s [fɔəs]); CURE and SQUARE by Upton (1995): [kjɔː] (vs. Gimson’s [kjʊə], 1962; already mentioned in Jones 1917) and [skwɛː] (vs. Gimson’s [skweə]), and also NEAR by Lindsey (2012a, 2019): [nɪː] (vs. Upton’s [nɪə]). I take all the vowels of (1d) to be long monophthongs, and all the vowels of (1a–c) to be “diphthongs”, or more precisely, not single monophthongal vowels. This categorization is based on the distribution of these vowels, to which we turn presently.
1. THE VOWEL INVENTORY OF BRITISH ENGLISH (BRE)
The vowel inventory of English is often split into tense and lax vowels. This distinction reflects that some vowels can be traced back to Middle English long vowels and diphthongs (these are tense), others to Middle English short vowels (these are lax). However, in nonrhotic British English, where compensatory lengthening ensuing the loss of historical [r] and the later loss of
[ə] produced long vowels merging these two categories (e.g., far [far] > [faː]; fire [fajr] > [fajər] > [fajə] > [faə] > [faː]), the tense vs. lax split is partly merged, and so it is not meaningful any more.
