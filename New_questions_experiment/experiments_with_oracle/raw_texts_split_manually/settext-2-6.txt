Let us see now how the necessity of two different distinctive features, [voice] and [fortis], for the phonological representation of the laryngeal contrast in Hungarian and in English can be supported. 
a. The phonetic basis for the assumption of two laryngeal features 
As discussed above, contrary to what the phonemic transcription suggests (together with the spelling), the phonetic (i.e., physical) realizations of plosives in word-initial position are different in the two languages. In Hungarian, it is actual vocal fold vibration, i.e., active voicing, that the contrast lies in: /paːl/ is pronounced [paːl], and /baːl/ is [baːl] on the surface too. In English, on the other hand, the lenis plosive of /boːl/ is not necessarily voiced on the surface (it tends to be only partially voiced or totally voiceless, so [b̥ oːl~poːl]), and the fortis plosive of /poːl/ is not only voiceless but also aspirated ([phoːl]), which show that the distinctive laryngeal property in word-initial plosives in English is not voicing but aspiration. Therefore, more recently, in nontraditional analyses, obstruents like /b, d, g; v, ð, z, ʒ; ʤ/ continue to be laryngeally specified in Hungarian-type languages, so they contain the feature [voice]; the laryngeally unspecified series contains obstruents like /p, t, k; f, θ, s, ʃ, h; ʧ/; however, in English, laryngeal specification is the other way around: /b, d, g; v, ð, z, ʒ; ʤ/, which are only passively voiced in intersonorant position, form the unspecified series, while /p, t, k; f, θ, s, ʃ, h; ʧ/, the plosives of which bear the distinctive property aspiration, are taken to be specified for a distinctive feature, [fortis]. 
b. The phonological basis for the assumption of two laryngeal features 
Besides the phonetic realizations of obstruents, their phonological behaviors also support the idea that the two obstruent series should be represented differently in the two language types. Let us consider the English word /dɪsgráfɪjə/ and its Hungarian equivalent, /dizgraːfiɔ/. What happens in Hungarian is that the voiceless /s/ of the prefix /dis/ undergoes voicing due to the voiced /g/ following it in the next morpheme (we know that the final obstruent of the prefix was underlyingly /dis/ by observing forms like /dislɛksiɔ/, where the following sound is a sonorant consonant or vowel (in this case, /l/), which cannot change the laryngeal identity of the final obstruent of the prefix). This process is called voice assimilation, and as its direction is right-to-left, it is referred to as regressive voice assimilation. As for English, no such assimilation takes place, which is what we expect since voicing is not a distinctive property of lenis obstruents in the language. This follows from the different representation of obstruent series in the two language types, illustrated in (10): In Hungarian, the voiced obstruent /g/ is specified for the distinctive feature [voice], which exhibits backward spreading and turns the preceding voiceless /s/ into a voiced /z/. In English, on the other hand, the lenis /g/ is laryngeally unspecified and therefore cannot affect the fortis /s/ before it, which is the marked obstruent, specified for [fortis].
