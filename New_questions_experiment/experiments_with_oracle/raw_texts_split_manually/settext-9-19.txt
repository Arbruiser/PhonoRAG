Don’t worry, you will not have to remember these accent areas, but you will have to be able to interpret the changes, for which the map below will come in very handy. For this you will have to remember the RHOONGE battle cry which will vary depending on which accent region you come from (see (17)).

The map shows all the features discussed so far with + and − signs. So, the Southeast is characterised as not having word-final and pre-consonantal R (−r), some speakers will not have h at all (−h), there will be both ʌ and ʊ (shown here with ʌ, given that it is a phoneme brought about by the FOOT-STRUT split), the velar nasal is a phoneme (ŋ), and the vowel of FACE is diphthongal (ɛj or eɪ). Wales will be very similar, the difference only residing in a monophthongal FACE vowel (eː), and so on. 
 	As we remarked earlier, isoglosses can cross in any way imaginable. Let us see one interesting case, known as BATH-TRAP split. As a split it is similar to the FOOT-STRUT split in that an original vowel in two different environments split into two sounds which now represent two phonemes. Let us look at the map below.
