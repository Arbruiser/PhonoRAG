(2) Ordinary Wh-question: FALLING TONE. 
(I know a much better pub.) —  Where? (neutral question)

(I know a much better pub.) — \kWhere? (= “Oh, really? Tell me!”) 
(4) “Please-repeat” question: HIGH-RISING TONE. 
(There’s a better pub in Yahoo Street.) —  Where?? (= “Sorry, couldn’t hear.”) 
END OF CHAPTER 7 
 In transcription, it is customary to use a secondary-stress mark on the originally stressed (now tertiary-stressed) syllable of the second element if it is longer than one syllable: fíre alarm /0faIər əˌlá:m/. 
 In Hungarian invisible compounds are less frequent, e.g. túrós csusza, mérges kígyó. 
 Weekend, ice cream are true compounds in AmE, having initial stress. There are a number of such differences between the accents of English. 
 Observe that finally-stressed compound adverbs and verbs are normally spelt with a hyphen or as one word. 5 This uncertainty only arises when the compound is spelt as two words. (Only one or two finallystressed compounds are spelt as one word: w ekénd, aròmathérapy.) Good dictionaries give the stress pattern of compounds even when they are “invisible”, spelt as two words.
