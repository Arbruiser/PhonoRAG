Function 
The falling tone has the following functions/meanings: 
(a) Definiteness. The fall is the most neutral intonation. In statements and commands it expresses definiteness and finality. It suggests that what we say is plain new information.  Statements: 
 	There ′isn’t e′nough Ttime. 	 	 	Her ′book was ′published in .French. 
• Commands (serious, businesslike, not too polite): 
 	′Keep your ′door ′safely  locked. 	 	′Open your ′books at ′page fif.teen! 
• Exclamations (to express surprise, etc.). 
 	′What a ′marvellous ′picture!  	 	′How ′utterly distgusting! 
(b) Wh-questions. The fall is used for Wh-questions (i.e. questions beginning with a question-word such as who, what, where, how, etc.): 
 	′What’s her ′new a ddress? 	 	 	′Who’ll be the ′chief ?editor?  ?When?  	How ?much?  	 	′What ?size are they? 
To sum up: the fall is used for statements, commands, exclamations and Wh-questions.
