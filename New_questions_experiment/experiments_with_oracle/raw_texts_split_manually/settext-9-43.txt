The relative ‘age’ of MVD (as compared to HVD) is signalled by its categorical status. American English broke off before either MVD or HVD started to work.  It thus only has the wide diphthongs, which are not the result of either MVD or HVD. We can also see that the breaking of the wide diphthongs in British English shows similarities with the newest wave of breaking of the historical tense high vowels (fiery, sourest, Moira (with the wide diphthongs), serious, tourist (with diphthongs from HVD) have optional breaking before onset R). We would still not want to say that these classes of diphthongs are equally old historically (the wide diphthongs are found in all accents of English, for example). 
 We have discussed some of the major rules of English phonology all the way from IndoEuropean. We have seen a few in-depth studies of how contrast can come into existence, how it can disappear and reappear. The story goes on. You may now pinpoint a few areas where a new contrast may be born in the future. This truly is a never-ending story.
