Here, however there is no absolutely no way of prediction which vowel will appear where (as opposed to the BATH-split, where at least a subpart of the original distribution is still observable and where the quality of the vowel is still predictable). You have now had a little taster of how historical phonological reconstruction works. 
The rest of the accent variables presented here (h-dropping, r-dropping, NG-coalescence, FACE-GOAT diphthonging), however, have not produced splits, they apply to every word across the board. The FOOT-STRUT split, the BATH-TRAP split and FACE/GOAT-diphthonging are taken to be the great accentual dividing lines between the South and the North of England. 
5 	R in the history of English  
A major part of this chapter owes its existence to a sonorant consonant, namely the rhotic, i.e. r. Before we look at a series of changes set off by this consonant, let us first discuss where it can occur in the major accents of English.
