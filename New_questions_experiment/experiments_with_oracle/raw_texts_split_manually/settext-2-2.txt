So in English, the laryngeal contrast in word-initial plosives is actually realized as the presence vs. absence of aspiration, not as the presence vs. absence of voicing, like in Hungarian. In English, the plosives /p, t, k/ have aspirated and unaspirated allophones: [ph, th, kh] and [p, t, k]. These plosives are aspirated in the following environments (defined with reference to syllables): (i) word-initially (e.g., in [ph]áralyze, [ph]olíte and [pl̥]áy) and (ii) at the beginning of a stressed syllable (e.g., in a.[ph]éar and a.[pr̥ ]óve). In other positions, we find the unaspirated alternants (e.g., in ca[p] and ca[p].tain, where the bilabial plosives are syllablefinal, or in há.[p]en, where it is not word-initially and is at the beginning of an unstressed syllable). For further details about this allophonic alternation, please read “The distribution of aspiration”6 and “The effect of syllables”7 in Phonolec notes. 
      Now, let us turn to voicing in English. In the case of sonorant segments (i.e., vowels and sonorant consonants), the unmarked (= phonetically most natural) way of articulating them is with vocal fold vibration (in any language); this type of phonation (or voicing) is called spontaneous voicing. The unmarked case for obstruents, on the other hand, is to be voiceless (in any language), and in English, they can only be passively voiced. That is, if a native speaker of English pronounces an obstruent voiced, vocal fold vibration is not an articulatory target 
 
but can only be the effect of the neighboring sounds: if an obstruent is in intersonorant position, the voicing of the sonorants preceding and following it will “run through” it, turning it voiced. So in English, the obstruents /b, d, g; v, ð, z, ʒ; ʤ/ have the voiced allophones [b, d, g; v, ð, z, ʒ; ʤ] in intersonorant position (e.g., in a[b]out, li[z]ard, sen[d]ing) and a[bd]omen) and only partially voiced or entirely voiceless allophones elsewhere (e.g., in ball [b̥ oːl~poːl], bad [bad̥ ~bat], rise [rɑjz̥ ~rɑjs] and anec[d̥ ~t]ote). In Hungarian, voicing in obstruents is the result of active articulatory gestures, so here, we talk of active voicing. For further details on voicing and its distribution in English, please read “Types of phonetic voicing”8 in Phonolec notes. 
      What we have learned so far about the physical realizations of the laryngeal contrast in English can be summarized and illustrated through the following examples: In /p/aul vs. /b/all, the opposition is encoded as the presence vs. absence of aspiration: [ph]aul vs. [b̥ ~p]all. The situation is the same /p/ride vs. /b/ride, but here, aspiration is realized as the devoicing of the following sonorant consonant: [pr̥ ]ide vs. [b̥ ~p]ride. The laryngeal contrast is realized as the presence vs. absence of aspiration in de/k/rée vs. de/g/rée too, as the /k/ in the former is at the beginning of a stressed syllable; furthermore, since the /g/ in the latter is in intersonorant position, it will be passively voiced, an additional phonetic cue encoding the opposition: de[kr̥ ]ée vs. de[g]rée. As for á/t/om vs. Á/d/am, the /t/ in the former is not aspirated because it occurs word-medially and not at the beginning of a stressed syllable; however, the contrast is maintained via the passive voicing of the intersonorant /d/: á[t]om vs. Á[d]am. 
      What remains to be discussed is the following: as the /t/ in ba/t/ is not aspirated, and the /d/ in ba/d/ does not undergo passive voicing if not followed by a sonorant segment, both of them tend to be pronounced as a voiceless unaspirated [t]. Nevertheless, the laryngeal contrast is not neutralized (= does not disappear) in final position either. Then what phonetic cues are used to encode the opposition? As can be seen in (4), a vowel before “voiceless” obstruents tends to be shorter than a vowel before their “voiced” counterparts (e.g., bat [băt] vs. bad [bād̥ ~bāt] and rice [rɑ̆j̆s] vs. rise [rɑ̄j̄z̥ ~rɑ̄j̄s]), which is referred to as prefortis clipping (= prevoiceless shortening). A further phonetic cue that can encode “voicelessness” in the case of plosives and the affricate /ʧ/ in this position is preglottalization (a.k.a. glottal reinforcement), i.e., the pronunciation of the glottal stop [ʔ] before these segments (e.g., in bat [băʔt]). For further details about the maintenance of the laryngeal contrast in final position, please read “Pre-fortis clipping”9 (and, if you are interested, “Glottalization”10) in Phonolec notes.
