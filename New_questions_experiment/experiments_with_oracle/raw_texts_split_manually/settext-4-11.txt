I argue that there are several reasons to analyse unstressed FLEECE, GOAT, and GOOSE as KIT, STRUT, and FOOT, respectively, followed by the consonant [j] in the first case, and the consonant [w] in the latter two. On the other hand, there is no reason to take these sequences to be diphthongs: we have seen that suffixes or clitics do not provide evidence for such an analysis. In fact, if they are taken to be diphthongs, then we encounter a rather unexpected vowel strengthening in unstressed position (known as HAPPY-tensing). In Szigetvari (2016), I look at English vowels in stressed position too and come to the same result. In the present paper, I survey evidence provided by these vowels in unstressed position. The reasons for analysing unstressed [ij], [əw], and [uw] as VC, not as VV are the following:
1. the first parts of [ij], [əw], and [uw] are identical to the three unstressable short vowels, [i], [ə], and [u];
2. the change of word-final and prevocalic [i] into [ij] in unstressed position makes sense only if [ij] is VC;
3. the optional or obligatory loss of [w] from unstressed [əw] and [uw] in preconsonantal position makes sense if they are VC;
4. the stability of [i] and [u] before the homorganic glides [j] and [w] is parallelled by thestability of the same unstressed vowels before a homorganic consonant.
