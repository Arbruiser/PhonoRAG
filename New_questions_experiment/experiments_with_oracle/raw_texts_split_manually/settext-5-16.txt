Form 
The voice falls from high (or mid) to low, then immediately rises to mid-high again. Thus the second half of this tone is a low rise. If there is a tail, its syllables continue to rise to midheight.

The \Tfirst part is interesting. 
 
Function 
The fall-rise has the following functions/meanings: 
(a) Implications. What we say is not the whole truth. The speaker has reservations, does not agree completely, or is hesitant to plainly say his opinion: “yes, but...” We call it implicational because it implies something that remains unsaid (this is added after three dots in the examples below). 
 	(Shall we go by car?) — \ Fine.  (...but I won’t drive)  	We ′like to \.travel.  (...but not to silly places like that) Such sentences often have a dislocated tonic: 
 	The \ FIRST part is interesting.  (...but the rest isn’t) 
The implication conveyed by the fall-rise is often that something should be done: 
 	\ Dinner’s ready!  (...so come and sit down) 
 	I ′can’t \ lift this.  (...so please help me) 
 
(b) Partial negation. The fall-rise is able to express partial negation (see the (b) sentences below), implying that the thing is true on the whole, but some part of it is negated. While ordinary full negation (a), expressed by the fall, simply means “no”, the partial negation expressed by the fall-rise means “yes, but...”. Compare: 
(a) I ′won’t ′eat Ianything.  (full negation; ‘I will eat nothing’) 
(b) I ′won’t ′eat \Ianything.  (partial negation; ‘I’ll eat, but not everything’) 
    (a) We ′haven’t ′heard them  once.  (full negation; ‘never heard them’)     (b) We ′haven’t ′heard them \oonce.  (partial negation; ‘heard them many times’) 
(a) It ′wasn’t ′published because a Iwoman wrote it. 
 	 	(full negation; ‘it wasn’t published, and the reason was that a woman wrote it’) 
(b) It ′wasn’t ′published because a \Iwoman wrote it. 
 	 	(partial negation; ‘it was published, though not for this reason’) 
 
(c) Softening. Another use of the fall-rise is to soften the directness of commands or questions, which might sound rude or too official with the falling tone. 
• Polite commands (said rather like requests): 
 	\ Wait a minute!  	′Keep your \ passports ready! 	′Have a\pnother one! 
• Polite Wh-questions: 
 	′What’s your \ name? 	 	′How \?old is she? 	 	\ When? 
To sum up: the fall-rise is used for implications (including partial negation); to soften a command or a Wh-question.
