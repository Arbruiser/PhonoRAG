Vowel quality in English is related to stress. The general wisdom is that one vowel, schwa, only occurs unstressed, the other vowels may either be stressed or unstressed. There is some confusion about the use of the term “stress”, however. In many descriptions of English, this term is used synonymously with accent. It is certainly true that any vowel may occur without accent in English, but if we avoid the conflation of “stress” and “accent”, then a stressed vowel will be identical to a full vowel (and an unstressed vowel to a reduced vowel). In this terminology, which is what I follow in this paper, it is not the case that any vowel may be unstressed in English. In fact, all vowels in the inventory introduced in (3) occur stressed, but only a subset of that inventory occurs unstressed.
   The set of reduced (or unstressed) vowels includes schwa and two further vowels, KIT and FOOT, transcribed as [i] and [u], respectively, by Jones (1917), and as [ɪ] and [ʊ] by Gimson (1962). The second vowel in each of the following words is unstressed and together they illustrate all the possibilities: comet [komət], comic [komik], communal [komjunəl]. All three vowels occur preconsonantally, as in these examples.
   Word finally FOOT and GOOSE were in free variation earlier, with the latter gaining the upper hand. Jones transcribes value as [ˈvæljuː] with the alternant [-ju] added in brackets, implying it is the less frequent form (1917, xx), furthermore, he adds that for many words the variant with the short vowel is available, but not indicated in the dictionary (1917, xxx). We find this solution all the way up to the 14th edition (Gimson 1977). Both the 15th edition (Jones 1997) and the LPD (Wells 1990) lack the variant with FOOT altogether.
   Word-final reduced KIT has also been replaced by a long vowel, FLEECE. This change is called HAPPY-tensing (Wells 1982). To parallel the name, let us call the former change VALUE-tensing.HAPPY- and VALUE-tensing are claimed to take place not only word finally, but in prevocalic position, too. Wells (1990), who uses the redundant Gimsonian system [ɪ]/[iː] and [ʊ]/[uː] for transcribing the high vowels KIT/FLEECE and FOOT/GOOSE, applies two further symbols to represent the transition from the pre-HAPPY/VALUE-tensing state of the language (where these words have [ɪ] and [ʊ]) to the post-tensing state (with [iː] and [uː]), the “transitional” symbols are [i] and [u]. Accordingly, he has create [kriˈeɪt], where [i] is an abbreviation for “more conservative speakers may have [ɪ] here, others have [iː]”, and statuette [ˌstætʃuˈet], where [u] is similarly an abbreviation for FOOT or GOOSE. Since these symbols only occur in unstressed position, that is, they represent reduced vowels, they could be called schwee and schwoo, respectively (Lindsey 2012b). Word finally Wells does not apply schwoo, since, as we have noted above, VALUE-tensing has completed in standard British English in this position. It is important to emphasize that [i] and [u] are not members of the vowel inventory, they are transcriptional abbreviations or, from a different point of view, archiphonemes.
