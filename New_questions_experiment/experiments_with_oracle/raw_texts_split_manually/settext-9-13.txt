
The speech signal, however, is full of tiny changes appearing all the time, so there are any number of changes happening at any one time in any one language. There is no language with no variation among its speakers. In the photo in (9) you can see three changes happening at the same time (two of these have already started interacting, and there is every likelihood that they will mix with the third ripple of change as well). In linguistics the lake is the population that speaks a given language, the ripples are initiated by the same population of speakers. The abstract boundaries of a sound change are shown with an isogloss (iso meaning equal/same and gloss meaning word in Greek). It is an imaginary line that connects all those areas where a given word sounds the same.  
      Although the principle seems very simple, in all fairness this is much more complicated because human populations move and migrate and change location and are also influenced by their neighbours (as we have seen when we discussed areal linguistics). Changes in phonology (as well as other branches of linguistics) never happen in a vacuum or a petri dish. An isogloss is our best shot at understanding how far a change can get and where it may possibly have been influenced by other isoglosses, or by speakers of another language. (You can now understand why biologists insist on disinfection and sterile conditions, something that can never happen in real life in phonology. Perhaps this is why we will never really understand how linguistic changes dissipate and ultimately end. There is too much pollution and background noise, as it were.). Let us now see some of the major isoglosses in the UK.
