
(31) Scottish Standard English pre-r vowels 
 
(31) has all the possible environments where r can be found (preconsonantal and word-final, as well as before pre-vocalic r in mono-morphemic words). The control group contains vowels before consonants other than the rhotic (first column). SSE has tense and lax vowels. They differ in quality with the tense vowels (i, e, u, o) being generally higher than their lax counterparts (ɪ, ɛ, ʊ, ɔ). This is a relative notion (just compare the pairs on a vowel chart). The vowel a behaves phonologically (= distribution-wise) like a tense vowel: it can occur word-finally (e.g., spa), similarly to any other tense vowel. Schwa cannot be found stressed word-finally (this is a historical accident), but it can be found unstressed word-finally, just like any other tense vowel (Chína ə, similarly to látte late). (Recall that in CuBE schwa is also odd because it patterns phonologically with the long R-vowels.) 
      As you can see, in SSE r has had no influence on the preceding vowels. Pre-r vowels are no different to non-pre-r vowels. This may be because in SSE r is qualitatively different to both General American (GA) and SSBE r. In SSE the rhotic is more consonantal, and less vowel-like in pronunciation. Phonetically, it is a rolled r very different to the one found in GA and SSBE. We will not go into phonetics here, but compare it another major accent of English, GA. Note, however, that there is no lax ʊ before a coda R (this is due to a historical rule: ʊ > ə; note incidentally that SSE also has the FOOT-STRUT split). The lax ʊ is found before onset R (this only happens in a handful of words though, some of which are recent, like Buryat). 
5.3.2 	General American (GA) 
Let’s look at the vocalic contrasts before R in GA (see (32)).
