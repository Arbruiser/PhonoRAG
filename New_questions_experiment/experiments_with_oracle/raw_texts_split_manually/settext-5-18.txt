And ′is  she  Apermanently there? 
	———— 	————— 	——————————————— 
The English high rise is distributed over the tonic plus the tail, so sometimes five or six syllables keep rising steadily (as above in ...permanently there?). If there is a tail in the English high rise, Hungarian learners will tend to use their rise-fall. This is dangerous for communication as the English ear will only hear the fall at the end, and interpret the intonation as falling, i.e. not a question. 
Function 
(a) The high rise is mostly used in Yes/No questions, whether they are grammatically wellformed interrogative sentences or not. 
′Did you ′park the ′car?  	 	′Could I ′bring it ′back on ?Saturday? ′One of the teditors? 	 	dAre you? 	 	 Birmingham? 
(b) “Please-repeat” questions. These are Wh-questions asking for the repetition of something just heard. Such “please-repeat” questions have a dislocated tonic on the question word. 
(Jennifer is in Kuala Lumpur.) — (WHERE’s Jennifer?? 
(Watson will be the new chief editor.) — (WHO’ll be the new chief editor?? (My girlfriend is thirteen.) —  HOW old is she?? 
The question-word bearing the tonic can also remain in the syntactic place where the questioned element stands in the statement. In this case the word order is not question-like: 
(She bought herself a platypus.) — She bought herself a (WHAT?? 
(We’ve got tickets for the 2am performance.) 
— You’ve got tickets for —WHICH performance?? 

(Zöl↑de↓ket? Zöldsé↑ge↓ket?), only the penult will rise and the ult will fall back. This is the characteristic Hungarian “rise-fall”, used for Yes-No questions. For example:

		Zöld? 	 	 ZZöldek? 	 	  ZZöldeket?  	ZZöldségeket?
