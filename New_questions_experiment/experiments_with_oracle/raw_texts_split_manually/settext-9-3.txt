
(1) Vocalic changes in the history of English (excerpt) 
 	 
(Kamil Kazmierski, Vowel-Shifting in the English Language: An Evolutionary Account, Walter de Gruyter) 
A historical linguist, who knows how to interpret the data of the present stage of English (coupled with what one can gather based on historical evidence like sound recordings, film footage, manuscripts, pieces of non-literary texts like an ancient shopping list or graffiti, inscriptions on stone, data coming from comparative reconstruction of related languages, etc.) will be able to tell you with some level of certainty that… 
(i) verb-final voiced fricatives (e.g., house hawz, graze, heave hɪjv, loathe ləwð) show that there used to be an infinitive suffix after them (so housen, grasen, etc. originally). The suffix was there after all verbs, but it left no trace of its presence with verbs ending in other types of consonants 
(ii) that grass ɑː (now with a ‘long a’ in CuBE) had a short vowel historically, but graze (which originates in grass) originally had a long vowel (now it has the diphthong ɛj) 
(iii) irregular plurals like wives, hooves, houses -zəz, paths ðz used to be regular in Middle English 
(iv) irregular verbs like swim with its past tense swam and past participle swum also used to be regular in the very distant past (v) etc. 
And the list continues. This doesn’t mean, of course, that every irregularity ceases to be irregular in the past. But before we continue with an analysis we have to ask ourselves ‘what can be compared with what?’, ‘What counts as similar?’ ‘What does similarity mean at all?’ ‘How far can similarity extend?’
