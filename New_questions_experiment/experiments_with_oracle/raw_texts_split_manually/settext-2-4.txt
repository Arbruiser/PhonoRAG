For a discussion on this issue, please read “Fortis fricatives”12 and “The effect of syllables”13 in Phonolec notes. 
      We can observe in English, among other languages, that there is no aspiration after /s/—or, more precisely, after fortis fricatives in general. So while we can find aspirated plosives in words like [ph]eak and [kh]ool, the plosives in s[p]eak and s[k]ool are unaspirated, and so are the ones in dis[k]óvery and fíf[t]éen (cf. níne[th]éen). 
      To account for the absence of aspiration in fortis fricative + plosive clusters, we may resort to referring to syllables. Note that we said earlier that a fortis plosive can be aspirated at the beginning of a word or at the beginning of a stressed syllable. This condition is not fulfilled in s[p]eak, s[k]ool and di.s[k]ó.ve.ry, as their plosives are not word- or syllable-initial, so we indeed expect them not to be aspirated. However, there is no aspiration in words like fíf[t]éen or káf[t]an either. The absence of aspiration could fall out of our syllable-based analysis only if we assumed the following syllabifications: fí.f[t]éen or ká.f[t]an, ending up with a syllable-initial /ft/ cluster, which does not occur word-initially. This leads to a peculiar situation since the occurrence of a consonant cluster in syllable-initial position is generally taken to imply the occurrence of that cluster in word-initial position too (therefore, e.g., atlas is to be syllabified as at.las and not as *a.tlas because /tl/ is not a possible word-initial cluster). 
      The problem seems to be better solved if we do not let the spelling affect our phonological analysis. If we have an audio recording of the word speak, and we chop off the /s/ from the beginning of the word and ask a native speaker to identify the word they hear, they will say beak and not peak. It should not be too surprising if we know that a word-initial plosive pronounced without aspiration will be perceived as a lenis segment. So we could analyze the unaspirated voiceless plosives in s[p]eak, s[k]ool, dis[k]óvery, fíf[t]éen and káf[t]an phonologically as lenis plosives: s/b/eak, s/g/ool, dis/g/óvery, fíf/d/éen and káf/d/an. Actually, the identification of such clusters as fortis fricative + lenis plosive clusters is reflected in the spelling of Wesh: ‘Spain’ is Sbaen and ‘school’ is ysgol.

2.3.1 The phonological makeup of segments 
The phonemes of a language can be analyzed as units decomposable into so-called distinctive features—phonetic features that distinguish one phoneme from another. For example, the features relevant for distinguishing /t/, /d/ and /n/ are the ones shown in (5).
