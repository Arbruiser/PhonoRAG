In the preceding sections we discussed one component of prosody: stress. We now turn to the other prosodic component: intonation. While stress concerns the loudness of syllables, intonation concerns their height, called “pitch” in linguistics.14 People easily confuse a high pitch with a loud stress: these often appear together, but are not the same (see the examples in 7.1). Intonation includes two things only: the melodies or “tones” (with their meanings and functions), and the division of speech into tone-units (that is, where one intonation pattern ends and the next one begins).15 
 The pitch of the speaker’s voice is influenced by several factors. (a) natural factors (= “symptoms”) like sex and age: women and children have a higher pitch than men, and every person has a characteristic pitch; (b) paralinguistic factors: an excited speaker will use a higher pitch than someone who is tired or bored; (c) linguistic factors: the pitch may depend on whether the utterance is a question or a command, old or new information, encouraging or neutral. These linguistic factors belong to the field of intonation.  
 Besides pitch, speech has other features like loudness and tempo, and is accompanied by gestures and facial expressions (sometimes called “body language”), all of which are important for communication, but do not form part of the linguistic system.
