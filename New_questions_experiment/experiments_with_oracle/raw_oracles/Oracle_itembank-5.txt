The English high rise is distributed over the tonic plus the tail, so sometimes five or six syllables keep rising steadily (as above in ...permanently there?). If there is a tail in the English high rise, Hungarian learners will tend to use their rise-fall. This is dangerous for communication as the English ear will only hear the fall at the end, and interpret the intonation as falling, i.e. not a question.
