"""Sets of vowels potentially categorized as diphthongs in English a. PRICE, MOUTH, CHOICE b. FACE, GOAT c. FLEECE, GOOSE d. NEAR, SQUARE, FORCE, CURE
Practically all accounts of English take the vowels in (1a) to be diphthongs.1 Accounts of British English2 count the vowels in (1b) to be diphthongs too, those of American English are varied (diphthongs in Chomsky & Halle 1968; monophthongs in Kenyon & Knott 1953 or Giegerich 1992). Sweet (1900) transcribes FLEECE and GOOSE as [flijs] and [guws], it is only Jones (1917) who (wrongly, as I will argue) alters the British tradition, and introduces the currently prevalent monophthongal symbols [iː] and [uː] for the vowels in (1c). American accounts again vary, the typical case is to lump the vowels in (1b) and (1c) together, either as diphthongs ([ey], [ow]; [iy], [uw]) or as (tense) monophthongs ([e], [o]; [i], [u], respectively). The vowels of the last group, (1d), are vowelþ[r] sequences in rhotic American English, occasionally centring diphthongs. In British English they were diphthongs at the beginning of the last century, but have all gradually monophthongized. This is reflected in the transcription of FORCE by Jones (1917): [fɔːs] (vs. Sweet’s [fɔəs]); CURE and SQUARE by Upton (1995): [kjɔː] (vs. Gimson’s [kjʊə], 1962; already mentioned in Jones 1917) and [skwɛː] (vs. Gimson’s [skweə]), and also NEAR by Lindsey (2012a, 2019): [nɪː] (vs. Upton’s [nɪə]). I take all the vowels of (1d) to be long monophthongs, and all the vowels of (1a–c) to be “diphthongs”, or more precisely, not single monophthongal vowels. This categorization is based on the distribution of these vowels, to which we turn presently"""

"""The vowel inventory of English is often split into tense and lax vowels. This distinction reflects that some vowels can be traced back to Middle English long vowels and diphthongs (these are tense), others to Middle English short vowels (these are lax). However, in nonrhotic British English, where compensatory lengthening ensuing the loss of historical [r] and the later loss of [ə] produced long vowels merging these two categories (e.g., far [far] > [faː]; fire [fajr] > [fajər] > [fajə] > [faə] > [faː]), the tense vs. lax split is partly merged, and so it is not meaningful any more.

"""The vowels in (2a) are often called checked vowels, since they are obligatorily followed by a consonant.4 This set is analysed and transcribed as “short5 monophthongs” in the British tradition (Jones 1917; Gimson 1977). The second set, the members of which are listed in (2b), are referred to as R vowels by Kreidler (1989). In the present analysis they are all “long” monophthongs. The last set contains vowels that may occur in all three environments, (2c). Following Trubetzkoy (1968) this set will be called free vowels. They are considered to be diphthongs by most analysts (or not, as we have seen above), although there are notable exceptions, like Batchelor (1809), 6 Trager & Bloch (1941); Trager & Smith (1957), who take these sequences to be a short vowel followed by a glide, an analysis I support with some evidence in this paper. Since the tense–lax contrast does not characterize British English, there is no reason to distinguish vowel symbols along this dimension. Accordingly and also for the sake of simplicity, I will use the six vowel symbols [i e a ə o u] as in (3), although “lax” symbols like [ɪ « ɔ ʊ], or distinct front and back [a ɑː], or a centralized symbol [ʉ] for the last vowel of each category, would perhaps be more appropriate if our aim were to be phonetically precise."""

The constraint against short vowels in word-final and prevocalic position has been generalized to unstressed position, which triggers the insertion (or, in the case of [uw], the retention) of the glide after these two short unstressed vowels. Most importantly, in neither case does this change make the syllable heavy, which would entail that it is less unstressable. It is well-known that word-final consonants are not moraic in English,19 so the glide does not add to the weight of the final syllable in the changes from [hapi] to [hapij] or [valju] to [valjuw]. The glide that appears between two vowels, as in the changes from [ındiə] to [ındijə] or [dʒaɡjuə] to [dʒaɡjuwə], is an onset, hence it does not contribute to weight either. That is, the unstressed syllables involved in HAPPY-tensing and VALUE-tensing remain light, hence fully unstressable."""

Why do stressed short vowels not occur either word finally or prevocalically in English?
# ! Because there is a constraint against short vowels in these positions
# Because they are always replaced by long vowels
# Because they are considered ungrammatical
# Because they undergo deletion in modern English

== cat 458
In what context do the unstressed short vowels [i] and [u] occur in the accent described by Jones and Gimson?
# At the beginning of a word
# In all syllable positions
# ! Word finally and prevocalically
# Only in stressed positions

== cat 459
What is the effect of inserting a glide after unstressed short vowels in processes like HAPPY-tensing and VALUE-tensing?
# It creates a new stressed syllable
# It adds weight to the syllable making it heavy
# ! It does not add weight to the final syllable, keeping it light and unstressable
# It shortens the duration of the surrounding vowels

== cat 460
Why do the glides that appear between two vowels, like in [ɪndiə] to [ɪndijə], not contribute to syllable weight?
# Because they are considered diphthongs
# Because they replace the vowel completely
# ! Because they serve as onsets, not adding to moraic weight
# Because they follow a long vowel, making them irrelevant
