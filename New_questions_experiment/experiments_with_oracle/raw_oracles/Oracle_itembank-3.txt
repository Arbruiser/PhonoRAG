The vowel symbols i and u are not particularly fortunate either for indicating the offglide of a diphthong, because they represent syllabic segments, which diphthongal offglides are not.

Its status is rather similar to that of force, for which Jones records a diphthongal ɔə pronunciation almost a century ago, but he deems it obsolete already in those days. The reason force became established as a monophthong is that separate symbols for it and north could not be maintained once the two vowels ceased to contrast. The homophonous pair mourning and morning cannot be transcribed differently, with ɔə and ɔː.

This distribution makes sense if we analyse diphthongs as vowel+consonant sequences. Thus it is the consonant clusters jl, as well as jr and wr that induce epenthesis.

What makes the wl cluster more stable compared to others, at least for some speakers?
# The cluster appears frequently in the English language
# ! Its members are homorganic, particularly for speakers with a velarized l
# It is followed by a vowel in most cases
# It is rarely used, so it avoids common epenthetic processes

"""Analysing diphthongs as VC (as opposed to VV) sequences influences stress-calculating algorithms in three cases. Firstly, in verbs final VV and VC is distinguished: the former is stressed, the latter is not (eg agree əgríj vs habit hábit. In fact, this distinction was not clear even in the time of its statement: word-final “long U” had to be listed as an exception (as in argue áːgjuw, continue kəntínjuw). In current English ij and əw also occur in final position in verbs without “attracting” stress (eg carry kárij, follow fóləw). Furthermore, there are VC-final verbs whose final syllable is stressed (eg omit əmít, rebel rəbél). Verbs that end in a diphthong followed by a consonant are stressed on their last syllable exactly like verbs that end in two consonants, so it makes no difference in this case if diphthongs are analysed as VC: both ferment fəmént and cremate krəméjt are stressed on their ult."""

== cat 361
Traditionally, how was the stress pattern typically determined for final VV and VC sequences?
# Both are usually stressed
# Both are usually unstressed
# VV is unstressed; VC is stressed
# ! VV is stressed; VC is not stressed

== cat 362
Which verbs exemplify a VC-final sequence where the final syllable is stressed?
# Carry and argue
# Rebel and continue
# Omit and ferment
# ! Omit and rebel

== cat 363
What does the analysis of diphthongs as VC sequences reveal about verbs like "ferment" and "cremate"?
# They are always pronounced with a long vowel
# They lose stress on their last syllable
# ! They are stressed on their last syllable similarly to verbs ending in two consonants
# They inherently avoid stress patterns completely

"""Secondly, Chomsky & Halle (1968: 72, 78) claim that a “long vowel” in the last syllable of a word is always stressed. Thus, although polysyllabic nouns are not usually stressed on their ult — which is extrametrical, says Hayes (1982) —, they are when this syllable contains a long vowel: cf arcade aːkéjd vs stipend stájpend. Burzio shows that “there is […] no reason to suppose that long vowels in final syllables are always stressed” (1994: 48–52). The “diphthong” in arcade is stressed like the VCC sequence in defence dəféns and the VCC sequence in stipend is unstressed like the “diphthong” (or, as claimed here, VCC sequence) in decade dékejd."""

== cat 364
What does Chomsky & Halle (1968) claim regarding the stress patterns of words?
# Vowels in the first syllable are always stressed
# Diphthongs in the medial syllable attract stress
# ! A “long vowel” in the last syllable of a word is always stressed
# Consonant clusters never affect stress placement

== cat 365
According to Hayes (1982), what is the typical stress pattern for polysyllabic nouns?
# They are always stressed on the penultimate syllable
# ! Polysyllabic nouns are not usually stressed on their ult — which is extrametrical
# They always receive primary stress on the first syllable
# Stress patterns are highly irregular and unpredictable

"""In accent D (New Zealand Acrolect) flapping occurs between two vowels only if the first vowel is short: it occurs neither after diphthongs (eg mitre *májɾə), nor after long vowels (eg martyr *máːɾə). We have argued that the absence of flapping after diphthongs is explainable if diphthongs are taken to be VC sequences, ie if a t is not in intervocalic position after a diphthongal offglide. If flapping also fails to occur after a long vowel then one may think this is also because such a consonant is not between two vowels, ie a long vowel is also a vowel followed by a consonant."""

== cat 366
When does flapping occur in New Zealand Acrolect?
# After any vowel regardless of type
# After long vowels and diphthongs
# ! Between two vowels only if the first vowel is short
# Between two vowels only if the first vowel is long

== cat 367
Which statement is false about flapping in New Zealand Acrolect?
# Flapping does not occur after diphthongs
# Flapping does not occur after long vowels
# ! Flapping occurs consistently after all vowel types
# Flapping requires the first vowel to be short for it to occur
