This is why sciences are impartial, seemingly cold and aloof, but objective, non-judgemental and non-personal (pretty much like a Buddhist’s view on the order of things). Think of biology or physics, for example: physics will never claim that a supernova is at a more advanced level than a red giant, nor will biology pass any judgements on the anatomy of a cockroach (as opposed to a swan, a willow warbler or a dolphin). Such statements would simply be laughable. The same principle holds in linguistics: we will observe, compare, analyse, establish orders of precedence of rules, but will never have anything to say about why something is better or worse than anything else we observe, because such statements are nonsensical in sciences."""

"""As it turns out, everything is part of a larger structure, and as such has a history as well. You may have wondered why the human respiratory system is as imperfect as it is (note that this is not a scientific statement, but a human sentiment). Our lungs are only capable of performing a bi-tidal respiratory function. This means that we can at any one time either inhale or exhale, but not both, and the lungs can never be totally emptied of the inhaled air. This is similar to the movement of the seas: we either have an outgoing tide or an incoming tide but not both. Birds, in contrast, have a different take on the problem: their bodies have a system of interconnected airsacks in addition to lungs, which ensures that air can both exit and enter their bodies at the same time through different channels (their nostrils and mouths). This anatomical trait ensures that they have all the energy required for prolonged flying, which is both energy- and oxygen-consuming"""

So, historically our lungs are closely associated with our stomachs, which explains why the air can only be inhaled and exhaled in one direction (air is basically food and food is normally only transported in one direction, away from the mouth into the stomach). As you can see, exhaling air can now be viewed as an evolutionary innovation (inhalation, just like passing food down our gullets, is older historically/evolutionary)."""

"""1.3 Do languages have a structural and a historical aspect to their analysis? The answer has to be in the affirmative. Analysing a language can happen at two independent, but complementary levels. One deals with structure: the system of contrastive building blocks (features like voice, nasality, place of articulation, manner of articulation), phonemes, contrasts, syllables (and whether they exist), stress (and whether any generalisations can be drawn on them based on the various patterns we encounter), intonation (and whether the various contours can be used contrastively and how this can be described). This approach you have been engrossed in up to now is synchronic linguistics (ancient Greek syn- ‘together, next to’ and chron- ‘time’, referring to units of analysis present at the same level of reference/slice of time, say 19th century English, or contemporary South African English), on a par with anatomy (no questions asked about where our lungs come from, only their function can be inspected and how they fit into the larger unit that we call the organism). This approach may have its limitations, but then the synchronic approach can never be aware of its own shortcomings because it doesn’t have the means to assess its own limitations. You are now aware why we say that ɛj (as in pane) and ɛː (as in pair) are two phonemes of this language, but you don’t know anything about whether this has always been the case or not. This is not a problem, you may not want to consider this a problem, or you may have other reasons to dismiss history, the fact remains that all analysts doing synchronic linguistics have to live with absence of history in a synchronic analysis."""

For example, it looks at whether languages have prepositions (like English, French, Croatian: e.g., in the school, sur la maison ‘on the house’, u kutiji ‘in the box’) or postpositions (like Hungarian: iskolában, házon, dobozban). It may also look at how morphological material is organised with respect to the base of the word: some languages have long complex words built up of a sequence of affixes centred around a syntactically independent semantic core and are thus word-based, like Hungarian, Finnish or Turkish: e.g., HU megmérettetéseidben ‘in your (singular) allowing yourself to be tested for what you can do (plural)’ with the ultimate stem mér ‘measure, test’, which is also an independently occurring word. 1 Some languages are stem-based (affixes are added to a syntactically non-independent core, as it is done in Latin, Greek or the Slavonic languages. For example, the stem behind the word for earth in Latin terra is terr-, something which can never be found on its own/in isolation (that’s why you will find a hyphen after such data): terr- is thus abstracted away from terra, terrae, terrā, terram, terrarium, terras and the rest of the shapes that this stem can take on. Hungarian and Latin thus belong to two different types of languages as far as morpheme independence is concerned. Both Hungarian and Latin, however, are referred to as synthetic languages (they synthesise a number of morphemes into long words). They contrast sharply with Chinese, which is an analytic language where there is little or no inflection (so there are no complex/synthetically inflected words). No language is perfect from any perspective, of course: Hungarian has bound stems (in játék ‘toy’ and játszik ‘to play’ there is a bound stem ját-), and Chinese has compound words (and thus its derivational morphology is not analytic). English is more analytic than Hungarian, but its inflection still shows signs of synthesising (boys boy+Plural is still a synthetically formed word, just like begs beg+3 person+singular+present+indicative). The derivational morphology of English can still be argued to be heavily synthetic."""

This, of course, doesn’t mean that English and Hungarian cannot be compared typologically or through contact (areal) linguistics (we have seen that Hungarian has extensively borrowed from English, but for a historical linguist this is skin deep)."""

"""The previous section has shown that in a historical analysis if you can set up phonological rules that trace the route a sound takes (in all the words in which it occurs in the same environment) through time allows you to say English and German are dialects of a now extinct language (West-Germanic). So, are English and German not languages, but rather dialects? The answer depends on your point of view. For a historical linguist a language is virtually the same as a dialect (of a now extinct dialect, which in turn may be the dialect of yet another extinct dialect, and so on ad infinitum). If you want to stick to the distinction between language and dialect, that distinction will mainly have to be established on a nonlinguistic basis. The basis will be routed in a social, cultural, military, naval or any other supremacy difference between the entities of which you want to elevate one to the status of an (official) language."""

"""Let us now have a look at a few isoglosses that criss-cross the United Kingdom (shown here with England, Scotland and Whales). We will have 6 of these characteristics to discuss briefly. Before we go there, it is worth asking what words we are using as our point of departure. Maps that show isoglosses always start with the comparison of cognates (= words that were ‘born together’ or found together in a now extinct language; go back to our discussion if you don’t understand this), not words that are viewed to have entered the language separately (i.e., independently of a common mother language). So, maps like the ones below will be based on words like bath and sun (two words that have been in the language since Germanic times), course (a word that entered English from French at least 500 years ago, before it branched off into GA or SSBE), but not banana, basil, sushi, sachet, gateau, jalapeno, quesadilla, chinchilla, chihuahua or the like that are viewed as relatively recent borrowings that have entered GA and SSBE separately on separate occasions (more on this below). This is crucial: words referred to above like bath, sun and course did not enter GA and SSBE separately on separate occasions, these words were present together (= they are cognates) in an earlier mother language from which both GA and SSBE develop"""

This isogloss shows those areas where the g is no longer found in the original *ŋg sequences word-finally or word-medially before a #-boundary. When g was deleted, a new phoneme came into existence (the velar nasal): long, sing, bring, sing#er all contained *ŋg originally (the velar nasal was not a phoneme then, its appearance having been predictable; recall the Nasal place assimilation rule from Chapter 1). After the loss of the velar voiced stop, ŋ became a phoneme (its presence is now unpredictable and it now distinguishes words, as in sing – sin – sim).

"""Not everything can be explained so neatly. The words mass ‘holy service’ and Basque can have both a long and short vowel (= free variation). Words like lass, bass ‘perch’, ass ‘donkey’, lash have short vowels, while ass ‘backside’ usually has a long vowel, as does moustache. The same is true for words in which the fricative was followed by a consonant: ask, task, mask, cask, rascal have long vowels, mascot, asp, Bafta have short ones. One possible explanation is that these words were ‘reborrowed’ from those accents in which the BATH-lengthening never happened (the non-SouthEastern accents). Bafta, of course, is too modern a word to be reborrowed. Here we must conclude that the rule of BATH-lengthening is dead as a rule, it ran its course and is no longer active.

"""What happens if historically lax (short) vowels are followed by coda R? Here the modern vowels are long and there is no coda R (spirt, serf, tar, port, burn). This is because of R-dropping (see (48 below), and the chapter on syllables in this course). However, coda R did not only drop (with compensatory lengthening), it also affected the quality of the preceding lax vowel in a process we have already discussed for GA (first nurse merging) plus backing of a to ɑ, and raising of ɔ to o. All these changes can collectively be referred to as pre-R broadening. This change is shared by SSBE and GA, which for a historical linguist means that American English and SSBE are closely related. As always, languages introduce new rules. SSBE, starting in the 18th century, started applying a rule known as Rdropping. After R was dropped, the vowels underwent compensatory lengthening, resulting in long broad vowels (as opposed to GA, where there was no R-dropping and hence the lax vowels are still short, and followed by R, of course). This is why SSBE and GA are still very closely related, but by no means identical. It also follows that if R was not dropped, the vowel is expected to be short. We’ll see if this is borne out by the data."""
