The constraint against short vowels in word-final and prevocalic position has been generalized to unstressed position, which triggers the insertion (or, in the case of [uw], the retention) of the glide after these two short unstressed vowels. Most importantly, in neither case does this change make the syllable heavy, which would entail that it is less unstressable. It is well-known that word-final consonants are not moraic in English,19 so the glide does not add to the weight of the final syllable in the changes from [h\u0001api] to [h\u0001apij] or [v\u0001alju] to [v\u0001aljuw]. The glide that appears between two vowels, as in the changes from [\u0001ındiə] to [\u0001ındijə] or [dʒ\u0001aɡjuə] to [dʒ\u0001aɡjuwə], is an onset, hence it does not contribute to weight either. That is, the unstressed syllables involved in HAPPY-tensing and VALUE-tensing remain light, hence fully unstressable.",

    "correct_text_chunk": "We have seen that stressed short vowels do not occur either word finally or prevocalically. In the accent described by Jones and Gimson, the unstressed short vowels [i] and [u] could occur in these positions: happy [h\u0001api], India [\u0001ındiə], value [v\u0001alju], jaguar [dʒ\u0001aɡjuə], and unstressed [ə] can occur word finally, but not prevocalically.

    "answers": [
      "a) Because they are considered diphthongs",
      "b) Because they replace the vowel completely",
