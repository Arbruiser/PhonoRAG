This is justifiable because these two vowels do not contrast: schwa only occurs in unstressed syllables, strut only in stressed syllables. The difference between the vowels of blunderers and blunderbuss may be seen as one of stress: bl\u0259\u0301nd\u0259r\u0259z vs bl\u0259\u0301nd\u0259b\u0259\u0300s. It is exactly because of this difference in their distribution that pedagogically oriented works employ the symbol \u028c for strut, despite the fact that a schwa, especially word finally, can be phonetically equivalent to strut (Jones 1922: \u00a7493, 1960: \u00a7362).",

The vowel symbols i and u are not particularly fortunate either for indicating the offglide of a diphthong, because they represent syllabic segments, which diphthongal offglides are not.

We have argued that the absence of flapping after diphthongs is explainable if diphthongs are taken to be VC sequences, ie if a t is not in intervocalic position after a diphthongal offglide. If flapping also fails to occur after a long vowel then one may think this is also because such a consonant is not between two vowels, ie a long vowel is also a vowel followed by a consonant.",
