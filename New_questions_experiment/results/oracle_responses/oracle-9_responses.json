You may have wondered why the human respiratory system is as imperfect as it is (note that this is not a scientific statement, but a human sentiment). Our lungs are only capable of performing a bi-tidal respiratory function. This means that we can at any one time either inhale or exhale, but not both, and the lungs can never be totally emptied of the inhaled air. This is similar to the movement of the seas: we either have an outgoing tide or an incoming tide but not both. Birds, in contrast, have a different take on the problem: their bodies have a system of interconnected airsacks in addition to lungs, which ensures that air can both exit and enter their bodies at the same time through different channels (their nostrils and mouths).

    "correct_text_chunk": "What happens if historically lax (short) vowels are followed by coda R? Here the modern vowels are long and there is no coda R (spirt, serf, tar, port, burn). This is because of R-dropping (see (48 below), and the chapter on syllables in this course). However, coda R did not only drop (with compensatory lengthening), it also affected the quality of the preceding lax vowel in a process we have already discussed for GA (first nurse merging) plus backing of a to \u0251, and raising of \u0254 to o. All these changes can collectively be referred to as pre-R broadening. This change is shared by SSBE and GA, which for a historical linguist means that American English and SSBE are closely related. As always, languages introduce new rules. SSBE, starting in the 18th century, started applying a rule known as Rdropping. After R was dropped, the vowels underwent compensatory lengthening, resulting in long broad vowels (as opposed to GA, where there was no R-dropping and hence the lax vowels are still short, and followed by R, of course). This is why SSBE and GA are still very closely related, but by no means identical. It also follows that if R was not dropped, the vowel is expected to be short. We\u2019ll see if this is borne out by the data.",
