    "correct_text_chunk": "7.7.2.2. The falling-rising tone Form The voice falls from high (or mid) to low, then immediately rises to mid-high again. Thus the second half of this tone is a low rise.

The \\\uf0e4first part is interesting. Function The fall-rise has the following functions/meanings: (a) Implications. What we say is not the whole truth. The speaker has reservations, does not agree completely, or is hesitant to plainly say his opinion: \u201cyes, but...\u201d We call it implicational because it implies something that remains unsaid (this is added after three dots in the examples below). (Shall we go by car?) \u2014 \\\uf0e4Fine. (...but I won\u2019t drive) We \u2032like to \\\uf0e4travel. (...but not to silly places like that) Such sentences often have a dislocated tonic: The \\\uf0e4FIRST part is interesting. (...but the rest isn\u2019t) The implication conveyed by the fall-rise is often that something should be done: \\\uf0e4Dinner\u2019s ready! (...so come and sit down) I \u2032can\u2019t \\\uf0e4lift this. (...so please help me) (b) Partial negation. The fall-rise is able to express partial negation (see the (b) sentences below), implying that the thing is true on the whole, but some part of it is negated. While ordinary full negation (a), expressed by the fall, simply means \u201cno\u201d, the partial negation expressed by the fall-rise means \u201cyes, but...\u201d. Compare: (a) I \u2032won\u2019t \u2032eat \uf0e6anything. (full negation; \u2018I will eat nothing\u2019) (b) I \u2032won\u2019t \u2032eat \\\uf0e4anything. (partial negation; \u2018I\u2019ll eat, but not everything\u2019) (a) We \u2032haven\u2019t \u2032heard them \uf0e6once. (full negation; \u2018never heard them\u2019) (b) We \u2032haven\u2019t \u2032heard them \\\uf0e4once. (partial negation; \u2018heard them many times\u2019) (a) It \u2032wasn\u2019t \u2032published because a \uf0e6woman wrote it. (full negation; \u2018it wasn\u2019t published, and the reason was that a woman wrote it\u2019) (b) It \u2032wasn\u2019t \u2032published because a \\\uf0e4woman wrote it.
